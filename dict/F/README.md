## forest park
 
 <i>n.</i> former name for conservation park q.v.

Unlike a forest, a park is enclosed, and [31] it does not have special laws or offices. In all the uses to which park has been put in England, until the recent adoption of National Park, there has been the idea of enclosure, as there is in the cognate paddock. The term forest park, as in the Tararua Forest Park, would once have seemed a contradiction in terms. (Sep 1958 -- ,Tararua,30) [NOTES: Ruth Mason `Track and Trail']

See Orsman for another more recent use in Auckland.]

>  <b>McINTOSH</b> Though his assertions may be discounted the spirit of Saunders's utterances may be taken as a reflection of the attitude of the popular party. In commenting on the fact that the power acquired by `the Original Resident Land Purchasers' Association' was retained long after the Company had ceased to exist, Saunders states `It became a leading and bitter opponent, a dangerous and mischievous class combination, facetiously called `The Nelson Supper Party' and more viciously called also `The Forty Thieves'. This party was very ably led by Dr., afterwards Sir David, Monro, and retained all political power in their own hands until some time after the introduction of representative government into this country. (1940 -- ,Marlborough,137) [NOTES: [Saunders in ? Nelson Examiner Oct 1857]]

>  <b>ROLLESTON</b> The notoriety of the defendants [at the 1873 Native Lands Alienation Commission] gave rise to their being called, variously, the twelve apostles (actually only seven were involved in the ownership of twelve shares) or the forty thieves. (1873 -- ,Master, The,96,1980 ed.)

>  In the outset of the Company's colonisation scheme, there were certain individuals who, by their disinterestedness in forwarding the establishment of the Company's first and principal settlement, obtained the sobriquet of the Forty Thieves ; and it appears that some individuals forming a portion of the Company's second Colony were anxious to rival the above-named gentlemen in a similar line of conduct. The one set proposed, that no individual holding less than five original land-orders in the settlement, should be eligible to a seat in their self- elected Council for the republican settlement of Britannia, well knowing at the time that none but themselves were qualified under such [a regulation, seeing that they were the holders of ten gratuitous landorders from the Company. The Nelson resident original landpurchasers, on the other hand, propose to exclude all persons who are not, like themselves, resident original purchasers, but who still originally emigrated here, and have become holders of land by purchase from them and the absentee land proprietors, and have embarked their labour and capital for various purposes, thereby promoting the welfare of the settlement, from any right to runs for cattle and sheep upon the waste lands.

>  <b>KEENE</b> During the 1850s large areas of Crown Land were made available under the 40-acre system, which entitled an adult immigrant on payment of his own fare from Britain, to a grant of 40 acres, plus 40 for his wife, and 20 for each member of his family aged between five and 18 years. Under the 40-acre system the immigrant gave an undertaking to remain in the province and not sell his land for a period of five years, after which time he would be given the freehold title of the land.

## forty-fives
 
 <i>n.</i> a West Coast card-game [(plural)]

>  <b>WOOD</b> I [the Otago Goldfields Commissioner] cannot describe how welcome that `clay' [pipe] was to me, ... with Dub. [Dublin, an Irish miner], Mexican and Pat, for my companions; the others having gathered round the rough table to enjoy the Irish game of `Forty-fives'. (1875 -- ,Waiting for the Mail,32) [NOTES: (`Beside the Billy')]

>  <b>PFAFF</b> Consequently larger numbers grouped themselves outside [the Reefton Courthouse], where they passed the time in playing cards - the favourite game in those days [c.late 1860s] being `forty-fives'. (1914 -- ,Diggers' Story, The,110)

>  A background of the haze engendered by tobacco and coal [in Buller pubs] is cards. As staple as beer is, more so is the game of `forty-fives', impossible of definition, where the five of the trump suit beats all other cards and the table gets a thumping. It accumulates all the good-natured interest and noise of which pubs are capable. (1948 -- ,NZ Geographer,166) [NOTES: Pascoe `Coal from Buller']

>  In smoky little back parlours [in Westport] friendly little groups meet to play `forty-fives' with uproarious oaths and much heavy thumping of the table. For [100] the uninitiated it may be stated that in this game the five-fingers (the five of the trump suit) beats all other cards. The trump suit order is five, jack, ace, king queen - all other suits begin with the king. Non-trump suits win high in red; low in black. Obviously the ace of diamonds is the lowest card in the pack unless diamonds are trumps, in which case it is the fourth best. The word `obviously' in the preceding sentence is a little optimistic - as the ace of hearts (the Maggy) is always the third best trump. It is credibly reported (a) that the game is of Irish origin (b) that there are no written rules (c) that the game can only be learned by playing it, and (d) it is as characteristic of Westport as whitebait or coal. (1948 -- ,Our Own Country,99) [NOTES: Korero Our Own Country]

>  <b>PEARSON</b> [Gloss] Forty-fives: A peculiar card game played on the West Coast, imported originally from Ireland. (1963 -- ,Coal Flat,420)

>  <b>CRUMPTON</b> The game played was called Forty-fives, and he could make neither head nor tail of the method of play. There was no money on the table, but a record of games played and won was made on a cribbage board by shifting a match about in the holes. At the conclusion of each game and [sic] a score of forty-five was reached, the losers shouted drinks for the other players, and the cards were shuffled round again. ... The fourth man stood up and excitedly thumped the table with the five of hearts. `I've been waiting for that, twenty-five - one - five, now lead and keep leading.' Play and conversation went on in a similar strain. Dave endeavoured explain the rudiments of the game. `The sequence of the game is highest in red cards and lowest in black. The highest card in the pack is the five of whatever suit turns up, then comes the Jack, and the ace of hearts is always the third highest trump in the pack. But you'll never learn the game looking on, it's too hard to follow. They play four legs to a game which is called a `horse.' Jim's playing a hundred pounds a game, twenty pounds a leg, and twenty pounds at the completion of the game. Then they start again.' (1979 -- ,Spencer: the Gold Seeker,41) [NOTES: [West Coast]]

## forwarding yard/forwarding pen
 
 <i>n.</i>

They in turn communicate by a two-way gate with the mouth of the Drafting race: This race is long and narrow just wide enough for the sheep to pass through in single file.

There is an absolutely positively Wellington origin about the distinctive Fun Ho! trademark, too. The design with exclamation nmark was by the late E Mervyn Taylor, a New Zealand arrist who worked in the city at the same time as an illustrator and commercial artist...

>  <b>RICHARDS</b> At one time Jacobs leased about 2000 acres of the usually useless [Chatham] Tobacco Country. He wanted it for the fungus that grew so abundantly on the kopi trees which formed the main portion of that forest. This he gathered to export to China. The very large, soft circular fungus could also be induced to grow on logs and roots split open and placed in an old tin shed. There copious watering soon covered everything with the huge white growth and all Jacobs had to do was to pull it off the logs and spread it out to dry. A pile a foot or so high would only yield a few handfuls of dry chips. When ready for packing it had to be damped once more to keep it from turning into powder. It never went mouldy because it was a mould to start with. When first sent abroad the Islanders got 4d. a pound for it, later only 2d. Even at that price they stripped the forests and killed the goose. Jacobs seems to have been the only one who attempted to cultivate it.

If a player's `taw' touched a marble and lay alongside it, the others would shout `knuckle down' just before his turn. ... `Knuckle down' meant that the player had to hold his taw close to the marble attacked and fire it in that very inconvenient position. ... When a boy lost all his marbles at play he was `scat' [?related to skint ?HWO] . ... A `ringer' was a taw which, when fired at the commencement of the game, lodged in the track of the ring itself; that, and knocking a marble out when he `fired' were the perfect shots. ... To fire a shot while holding the hand nearer to the ring than where the taw had lain, was to `funk', an unforgiveable crime. (1972 -- ,Folkgames of Children,176)
