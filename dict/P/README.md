## pa
 
 <i>n.</i> a type of fish hook, couta stick

>  <b>GRAHAM</b> BARRACOUTA (MANGA) <i>Leionura atun dentatus</i> (Bloch and Schneider) INCREDIBLE as it may seem these fish, with their well-armed jaws of sharp fang-like teeth, were usually caught on a slightly curved stick about four feet in length. Fastened to this stick was a piece of stout fishing line about three to four feet in length, carrying a piece of red-coloured wood - usually cedar - about five to six inches in length. A bent nail was secured to this piece of wood in the form of a hook but no bait was used. When a school of Barracouta was found the Couta stick, or paw, was brought out ready for fishing. From the cockpit of the launch the piece of wood with the nail was violently swirled with a circular motion in and out of the water, causing a disturbance of the water in a good imitation of a number of Sprats, Pilchards or other small fish jumping in and out of the sea. The Barracouta would swim for such a place. Seeing the piece of red wood moving rapidly through the water they would take it for a fish, snap at it or even jump out of the water for the lure and were caught by the crude iron hook. As the fish was hooked during the time the paw was being drawn through the water the fisherman would swing the fish over his head above the boat or launch and when the caught fish was midway in the air, more or less above the cockpit, would expertly give the stick a dexterous smart twist. As there was no barb on the hook the fish was released and fell into the cockpit. <i>Ibid.</i> 311 Should there be any Barracouta about the... Couta sticks were then set to work to paw the water and attract Barracouta to the spot. <i>Ibid.</i> 314 The Maori also knew he could catch Barracouta without bait and he, too, used a short piece of stick and line with a baitless hook and leaned over his canoe and threshed the water to and fro, which is known as `Kaihau manga!' When the European fisherman called his fishing outfit [315] `paw', the Maori uses the term `pa'. This fish was a great favourite with them and was caught in large numbers. On returning to the shore, the women cleaned the fish and then hung them up on racks to dry in the sun. Old Maoris of Opotiki told me they used a chip of Tawhai (<i>Nothofagus fusca</i>), which is dark red, in the making of a pa (paw). <i>(1956,NZ Fishes: An Identification Guide,310</i>)

>  <b>NOLAN</b> Paddocking: A square of ground was dug down to the paydirt layer. The paydirt was either extracted and worked in a pan, cradle or sluice box, or the paddock had one open end and was sluiced. Paddocks were often waterlogged and had to be continually bailed or pumped dry. <i>(1976,Historic Gold Trails of Nelson & Marlborough,88</i>)

>  There are several parties of miners sluicing in the main gully of this basin, who are averaging about 12s (twelve shillings) per day each in shallow sinking or paddocking, the greatest depth not exceeding 3 (three) feet, with plenty of water. <i>(May 10, 1862,Otago Witness,8</i>)

>  When my lot arrived they crowded the rail of the ship and cried, "What-ho, natives" (or, among the lower orders, like mine, "Wotcher, natives"). The people on the beach, somewhat nonplussed, I expect, needed a name to identify the new arrivals. They chose "pakeha".... These days it is used in government documents, even though there is confusion over just who is Pakeha: are Pacific Islanders Pakeha? Or Malaysian Chinese immigrants? Or Sudanese refugees?...

>  All people who live in urban industrial societies have their lives requlated by measured time. This concept of time is referred to by Maoris as `Pakeha time' and they conform to its dictates inasmuch as they are on time for work, to catch buses or to fulfil engagements. However, because they are bicultural, Maoris function in their own time-frame as well, which they refer to as `Maori time'. <i>(Sep 24, 1983,Listener (New Zealand Listener),59</i>) [NOTES: [Ranginui Walker]]

In Maori again no two consonants occur together, so that in using English words in Pakeha-Maori, a vowel must always be stuck in between consonants where they happen to meet. <i>(May 5, 1875,Timaru Herald,3</i>)

These plains are called `pakihi,' a word used in the North Island to signify dried up.

## partial impact
 
 <i>n.</i>

>  Partial Impact explains light, heat, electricity, gravitation, Freethought, Socialism, epidemic diseases, - explainds in short everything in the heavens above, the earth beneath, and the waters under the earth, except the unwillingness of the world to receive thte theory itself. <i>(Jul 31, 1880,Otago Witness,17</i>)

>  At the meeting of the members of the Philosophical Institute last evening, Professor Bickerton read a paper "On temporary and variable stars," in which he treated of the partial impact of two large bodies as a possible frequent occurence, and as giving a perfectly satisfactory explanation of temporary and variable stars, of double stars, of all kinds of nebulae, of comets, and indeed of all the varied phenomena of the universe. <i>(Jul 5, 1878,Star, The,2</i>)

>  This appears to be the position of Professor Bickerton's theory of Partial Impact, and we should say that he is justified in asserting that, "The fact that astronomers are working without it has already caused irreparable loss to science ..." <i>(Feb 12, 1894,Timaru Herald,4</i>)

>  Putting on full steam ahead, Hoani steered straight for the electric freight car, and disregarding Professor Bickerton's partial impact theory, he crashed full into Trow's wagon. <i>(Dec 31, 1921,NZ Truth,6</i>)

>  In 1878 Bickerton revealed his partial impact theory of the creation of new stars which formed the basis of his theory of cosmic evolution. The notion that the oblique collision of two stars produces a new, hot, rapidly expanding body without destroying the original two in the process explained virtually all astronomical mysteries for Bickerton, but provoked only indifference or scepticism from scientists. <i>(Sep 13, 1986,Listener (New Zealand Listener),28</i>)

>  Partial impact appears competent to explain the occurrence of temporary, double, and variable stars, nebulae of various kinds (the kind depending on the nature of the impact), comets, and finally stars or suns accompanied by bodies of smaller size. <i>(1879,TrNZI,XI/121</i>)

>  The hypothesis I am about to describe suggests that this is the case, but especially says further, that if they do knock against each other that the blow may be a mere graze of the two outside, or sometimes a large piece of each may be struck off, and in extremely rare cases they may meet fair; but as this latter isso extremely rare, the other cases are those chiefly considered, and so the theory is called Partial Impact. <i>(1880,TrNZI,XII/191</i>)

>  <b>JENKINSON</b> It was on 4 July 1878.. that Bickerton read before the Philosophical Institute of Canterbury his paper "On Temporary and Variable Stars" in which the main facts of the theory of partial impact were first announced. <i>(1940,New Zealanders & Science,00</i>) [NOTES: Pages needed]

>  <b>von HAAST</b> This was the first occasion upon which the Professor was to enunciate publicly his theory of "Partial Impact" which was to become an obsession with him. <i>(1948,Life & Times of Sir Julius von Haast,235</i>)

>  <i>Partial Impact: a possible Explanation of the Origin of the Solar System, Comets, and other Phenomena of the Universe</i>. By Professor A.W. Bickerton, F.C.S. ... <i>(1879,TrNZI,11/125</i>)

>  <b>HAAST</b> The hypothesis that I am about to describe suggests that this [collisions] is the case, but especially says further that if they do knock against each other, the blow may be a mere graze of the two outsides, or sometimes a large piece of each other may be struck off: and in extremely rare cases they may meet fair; but as this latter is so extremely rare the other cases are those chiefly considered, and so the theory is called <i>Partial Impact.</i> The effect of the collision of our two stars will be to strike a piece off each other where they touch, and each star will travel on with a slice cut off the side of each. The parts of each which met will be left behind by both the retreating bodies, and will probably remain where the collision occurred. But, owing to the way it has been struck off, the two sides being impelled in opposite directions, it cannot help revolving, and it is not unlikely that nearly all the thousands of rotating bodies and systems in the universe may have thus been set spinning by partial impact. At partial impact, rotation must ensue. The matter will tend to spread out more or less in a flare, with frequently gas at the poles and the middle body produced by the collision will generally be very hot, proportional to the mass. <i>(1948,Life & Times of Sir Julius von Haast,236</i>) [NOTES: 188? A. W. Bickerton to the Canterbury Philosophical Institute quoted in 1948 Von Haast Life and Times of Sir Julius Von Haast 236]

>  <b>LEE</b> As a youngster I remember the New Zealand press talking of Bickerton and his theory of partial impact. <i>(1965,Rhetoric at the Red Dawn,110</i>)

>  I want to know.. why your theory of partial impact is not being recognized and accepted in the scientific world. <i>(Jul 11, 1910,Triad, The,XVIII(4) : 49</i>)

>  He will never get weary / Of answering any query / On the partial impact theory; / Will you, Bick? <i>(1923,College Rhymes,14</i>)

>  It is most singular that this first, this fundamental, this absolutely basic idea of a third body, has for a quarter of a century been missed by astronomers. They have been bombarded with tens of thousands of papers and pamphlets. Diagrams showing the third body have been broadcasted before them by thousands and by hundreds.

## pavlova
 
 <i>n.</i> a meringue dessert cake, for which the first recipe was published in 1929 in New Zealand. [Note on conversation with Deidre Macken (60 yrs) about her mother's story (86 yrs). She was in the Wellington Ballet Company in 1926 and on news of Pavlova's tour wrote to her manager enquiring how they could help make her tour and reception more pleasant, her favourite colours, foods, etc. She expressed a great liking for meringue (cakes) so they consulted a chef who produced 3 attempts (e.g. a square cake was rejected in favour of a round one); finally the `soft-centre' variety was chosen. In her honour they named it Pavlova (?cake) and they presented this to Pavlova (? at a gathering) and she liked it a great deal. D. Macken is to research this - ? Ballet company records, etc. Deidre Macken (04) 384-6073 - H.D. Macken, Nairn St.]

>  The Editor,The DominionPavlova - Name and NatureSir, -- In spite of silly claims regularly surfacing especially in Australia (Dominion 2/2/99), the facts of the development of the confections and the date the name `pavlova' was applied to them have been reasonably well known for some years now. They may be found in the Dictionary of NZ English (1997), the Australian National Dictionary (1988), and the writings of Professor Helen Leach of Otago University.The name `pavlova' post-dated the ballerina Pavlova's Australasian tour of 1926, and was first applied in New Zealand by the Davis Gelatine Company in 1927 to a jelly dessert whose moulded multicoloured shape may have suggested a tutu. It was next (in 1929) applied independently (and only in NZ) as `pavlova cake' or `sponge' or `meringue' to the previously well known so-called `meringue cake' or `sponge'. The recipe change to the legendary pavlova icon is usually reputed in NZ to be the addition of vinegar to give the soft centre, and in Australia, the trademark of passionfruit in the topping. (The name `pavlova' does not occur in either the Futter book (1926) or the Terrace Tested Recipes (1927) mentioned in your report.)The elliptical simple form `pavlova' for the meringue is recorded earliest in Australia from 1940 (so AND, two of whose quotations acknowledge NZ as the originator) and in NZ from 1953 (DNZE).There is no evidence that the name `pavlova' was applied in Australia before 1940. Both countries share the earliest recorded date 1966 (and the same quotation) for the abbreviation `pav'.The New Zealand Dictionary Centre at Victoria University (Box 600, Wellington) would be glad of any pre-datings of any of the above, with author, title, date, and page references.Harry Orsman <i>(Feb 2, 1999,Dominion,00</i>) [NOTES: Check date of publication.

All he did, in 1935, was to make a meringue and cream cake that he said was "light as Pavlova", the Russian ballet dancer who six years earlier had stayed at the hotel. but the name stuck and thus was born the myth about its origins. The truth is that the large meringue with the marshmallow centre - the heart of the pavlova - was common in New Zealand in the early 1930s, even earlier. In 1927, for instance, there was a recipe for a meringue cake submitted by a Mrs McRae in the second edition of <i>Terrace Tested Recipes</i>, collected by the ladies of the Terrace Congregational Church in Wellington. <i>(May 18, 2002,Dominion Weekend Magazine,5</i>)

It is worth mentioning here that the Australians claim to have invented the pavlova, and insist that it was created in honour of Pavlova by a Melbourne woman in 1926. New Zealanders, however, might answer that in the same year a pavlova recipe appeared in a book entitled <i>Home Cookery for New Zealand </i>(although it went under the name of `Meringue with Fruit Filling') and that another recipe actually called `Pavlova' was published the following year.

 <i>n.</i> a measure

>  The use of perch as a square measure in New Zealand - one fortieth of a rood - may be noted. NSOD gives this as 'rare, except historical'. It became historical here only in 1968 with the advent of metrication, and was until then anything but rare. The area of every piece of land that could not be expressed simply in acres or roods was described in perches. The word occurred in thousands of land titles, and was used to define the size of any section smaller than the quarter-acre 'norm'. Perch as a linear measure on the other hand (as in NZPOD) I have never seen outside the backs of school exercise books! <i>(Jan 1999,NZWords,2</i>)

No longer do geologists illustrate the scale of the outcrop photographs with such mundane objects as hammer, lens caps, 2 cent pieces and bananas. If in the forefront of geological technique they now take as an essential item of field equipment, Percy Strong. Such is Percy's usefulness as a unit of stratigraphic thickness, and so great is the magnetism of his image on screen, that one lecturer introduced his choicest slide with the pronouncement "that's Percy", and only then proceeded to describe the rocks. It is understood that Cathy, with callous disregard for the visual effect on her husband's figure, is knitting for Percy a cap-a-pie jumpsuit with 100 horizontal stripes so that thin-bedded sequences may be measured in centi-Percies (cPe); and further that Percy himself now steers clear of field trips in areas of steeply-dipping strata, to avoid the necessity of being photographed in a horizontal position in stream beds. <i>(Feb 1981,Geological Society of NZ Newsletter,51/21</i>)

It's a very pretty creature with a crushed velvet body, greyish green - its whole body undulates beautifully - it's the missing link between the worms and the anthropods [sic] like crayfish or woodlice. It's segmented but each segment has a pair of small stumpy legs with two tiny claws." <i>(Nov 26, 1988,Listener (New Zealand Listener),42</i>)

>  It is most commonly called peripatus - from the same Greek root as <i>peripatetic</i>, meaning itinerant or wandering... The animal is also called the velvet worm or walking worm - references to two of its more obvious traits. Peripatus are found largely in the southern hemisphere - in Australasia, south-east Asia, Africa and Central and South America. <i>Ibid.</i> 66 I have to roll my peripatus onto its back again to view the circular, lobe-lipped mouth with double pair of sickle-shaped mandibles, and the two lumpy "gun turrets" - oral papillae - used to such effect in the capture and consumption of prey. Both the jaws and oral papillae, as well as the antennae, are pairs of modified limbs. Peripatus are opportunistic and will scavenge in preference to expending energy on hunting. <i>Ibid.</i> 74 Peripatus may boast a lineage more ancient than that of New Zealand's other, more famous, "living fossil," the tuatara. Early marine animals, such as this 500-million-year-old fossil from the Burgess Shale in British Columbia, appear remarkably similar to living onycophorans... <i>P. novaezealandiae</i> females.. have been found to carry embryos at all stages of development at all times of year, and to give birth regardless of the season, albiet more abundantly in summer. <i>(Apr 2000,NZ Geographic,No. 46/60</i>)

## Pigroot
 
 <i>n.</i> (the Pigroot) the inland road (State Highway 85) from Palmerston, north of Dunedin, into Central Otago, originally a trail followed by 19th-century goldminers. [probably from the presence of wild pigs in the area] [1889 cit. l.c. a kind of hill, cf. hogback]

>  No map the collector has consulted has shown Pigroot Hill or hotel, and yet it is the most prominent and most used name between Palmerston and Kyeburn. Again and again the collector has heard the remark, `I am going into the Central by the Pigroot,' or `I came down by the Pigroot.' So frequently is it used that one might imagine that certain people used it thinking that the word `root' is in reality `route,' but be that as it may, common usage is the deciding factor in place-names, and Pigroot, with its associations back into the fifties, has come to stay. The name was originally [9] bestowed because the wild pigs rooted up the hillside looking for the roots of the taramea, or speargrass, which they enjoy eating, and which is probably one of the main reasons why speargrass is so rare nowadays. <i>(1944,Maori Place-Names of Otago,8</i>)

## pin dip
 
 <i>n.</i>

>  <b>SUTTON-SMITH</b> Pin dips were also another popular amusement. `A pin or a bull or a button, To see a rary rary show show show!' (1875; Tahataki). A piece of glass backed by cardboard was covered with a piece of paper that could be flicked up to show the `rary rary show' or had a slit in it through which one could peep. One saw through the glass a variety of colors, pieces of colored paper, flower petals, pictures, and later pieces off cigarette boxes. Sometimes these had been arranged in some pattern, at other times they were kaleidoscopic only, and the perceiver had himself to add the configurations of intelligibility. The price for the view was always a pin `which we did not want anyhow but always accepted,' a relic from an age when such things were rare. Pin dips were known also as `poppy shows' (perhaps it was the similar flash of color that gave the same name - `the poppy show' - to the exciting experience of seeing a girl's dress blown upward by the wind; pins were not charged for flowers of this sort). In fact, the pin dip or the prick book may have developed from the poppy show. The poppy show was common before 1900 and the prick book after that date, a fact connected with the ever-increasing stock of picture cards and magazine pictures available to children. <i>(1981,History of Children's Play,223</i>)

>  <b>LAING & BLACKWELL</b> The common <i>Acaena</i> was called by the Maoris Piri-piri, but colonists frequently [usually] corrupt the Maori name, and call the plant Bidi-bidi. As a general rule, the Maori names are more incorrectly pronounced as we go southward from Auckland to Otago. This is largely due to the fact that, in the north, Europeans have been brought into closer contact with the Maoris than in the south. In some few cases, the difference in pronunciation may be due to differences in the Maori dialects. The changes that take place often follow phonetic laws - thus the Maori `p' is softened into the European `b' as above, while `r' is replaced by `l' or `d'. Poro-poro (<i>Solanum aviculare</i>) becomes Bulli-bulli, and Puriri becomes Boradi. This also explains such a form as `Kowdie' pine for Kauri pine. Korari - a flax-stalk - similarly becomes Koradi or even Kaladi [1907 edn ?mistakenly, <i>Kalladi</i>]. `K' is also sometimes altered into `g,' this Kie-kie (<i>Freycinetia Banksii</i>) becomes ghi-ghi. The last vowel in a reduplicated syllable was faintly pronounced in Maori, and often disappears altogether in the European form of the word, <i>e.g.</i>, Poro-poro gives Bulli-bull, and Piri-piri gives Bidi-bid. <i>(1907,Plants of NZ,202,1940 p 211 ed.</i>)

>  <b>HILGENDORF</b> PIRI PIRI (<i>Acaena ... sanguisorbae</i>). This name is commonly corrupted into [called] bidi bid.

## plant-caterpillar
 
 <i>n.</i>

>  <b>MORRIS</b> name given in Australasia to species of caterpillars which are attacked by spores of certain fungi; when chrysalating in the earth the fungus frows inside the body of the caterpillar, kills the latter, and then forces its way out between the head joints, and sends an upgrowth which projects beyond the surface of the ground and gives rise to fresh spores. Many examples are known, of which the more common are <i>Cordyceps robertsii</i>, Hook., in New Zealand; <i>Cordyceps gunni<i>i, berk, in Tasmania; <i>Cordyceps taylori</i> Berk, in Australia.<i> See</i> Aweto. <i>(1898,Austral English,360</i>)

>  <b>COOKE</b> `The New Zealanders' name for this plant-caterpillar is `Hotete,' `Weri,' and `Anuhe'... The interior of the insect becomes completely filled by the inner plant, or thallus (mycelium): after which the growing head of the outer plant or fungus, passing to a state of maturity, usually forces its way out through the tissue of the joint between the head and the first segment of the thorax ... it is stated that this caterpillar settles head upward to undergo its change, when the vegetable developes [sic] itself.' <i>(1892,Vegetable Wasps and Plant Worms,139</i>)

The name "pohutukawa" comes from "hutukawa" (a head-dress of red feathers) and "po" which has meany meanings, including night or underworld. Governor Grey interpreted this as meaning "the tree with red adornment near the sea", but "po" could equally be a reference to the traditional tree at Cape Reinga where the spirits of the dead descend via the pohutukawa tree to a secret cave, the entrance to Te Reinga, the spirit or underworld [sic]. A small, scrubby version still clings to the cliff edge at the leaping-off place of the spirits.

## Pokarekare Ana
 
 <i>n.</i> a popular Maori song

>  The documentary <i>Pokarekare Ana: A Maori Love Song</i>.. on the origins of the song, surrounds the contributions made by Sir Apirana Ngata and Paraire Tomoana with a misleading element of mystery... For a number of reasons, "Pokarekare" is unlikely tobeen the original work of either of these men. (1) "Pokarekare" was published in sheet music form in 1926 (twice), in 1927, 1936 and 1940 prior to Paraire Tomoana's death in 1946. The two 1926 versions are said to have been arranged by "Hemi Piripata" and "Alfred Hill": respectively. the 1927 version is said to have been arranged by "P H Tomoana and Archie Don". The 1936 version is said to have been "collected and sung by Ernest McKinley" and the 1940 version is again said to have ben arranged by "Hemi Piripata". in short, no published version of the song, including the 1919 booklet entry, gave any credit to either Apirana Ngata or to P H Tomoana for composing the song in their lifetimes... The most likely conclusion would seem to be that what has affectionately become "New Zealand's unofficial anthem" originated in the far north of New Zealand circa 1900 and was adapted. modified and developed in its journey through the country by a number of gifted Maori composers of the day. <i>(Apr 20, 2002,Listener (New Zealand Listener),6</i>) [NOTES: David Smith (Mandeville North, Kaiapoi)]

>  ...Tomoana explains the song's origin: "7. Pakarekare. These ditties emanated in the North of Auckland and were popularised in Narrowneck Camp, and eventually drifted to ... the East Cape. There they took the present form ... and acquired close association with the last drafts of single men from the East Cape and Wairoa districts ... the 19th and 20th Maori Reinforcements." <i>(Apr 27, 2002,Listener (New Zealand Listener),8</i>)

>  In 1978 I went with a Hamilton Teachers College kapa haka student group on a tour of Aboriginal settlements in Australia's Northern Territory... The group refused to include "Pokarekare Ana" in their repertoire because in their eyes the song had become a parody of the original, with "squashed banana" lyrics... At the Adelaide Festival, Rolf Harris asked us to accompany him in his latest hit, "Pokarekare Ana."... Anyone from Dame Kiri Te Kanawa down can sing "Pokarekare". It adds to the popular culture of New Zealand. <i>(Apr 27, 2002,Listener (New Zealand Listener),8</i>)

>  On hearing "Pokarekare" for the first time George Bernard Shaw immediately identified the music as a Swiss cradle song. <i>(Apr 27, 2002,Listener (New Zealand Listener),9</i>)

>  ...all too often what happens is someone gets sentimental and the song somehow stumbles on to become a mumbled medley involving "Pokarekareana". The full lyrics to which are "Pokarekareana Something Something Roto-rua". <i>(Apr 19, 2003,Listener (New Zealand Listener),28</i>)

The term is of Australian origin, of a period long ago when the military and other authorities of the time called the men of the penal settlements, `Prisoners of Mother England', which was shortened to P.O.M.E. and later made `Pommie'. The New Zealand term was `Homie' until superseded by the Australian adjective. And even now Pommie is being superseded by the term `Pongo'.

>  A Tasmanian gave the origin definitely as being `pomegranate', the colour of that fruit being similar to the high colour of the complexions of the English, and very noticeable against the sun-dried appearance of the Aussie complexion. This has been acceptable to many knowing the Aussies' susceptibility to using phrases such as `plates of meat' for feet and `trouble for strife' for wife. Pommy to many has become a most objectionable word owing to the way it has been used with other words. Only the most ignorant use of such terms, not thinking that their forefathers came from that same brave country. If my comrades of the Homeland, newly arrived, who use the nom-de-plume, or refer to themselves as `Pommies', read this they will now understand why it is objectionable even when used in a friendly manner.

>  Sir, - Fifty years ago a shipload of passengers arrived in Australia. Coming through the tropics, they got badly burned and their faces were scarlet.

So the Australians named the new arrivals `Pommies' (just fun), and `Pommie' is still used occasionally. -E.M.W. <i>(Dec 31, 1951,Christchurch Star-Sun,2</i>)

>  Sir, -A correspondent wishes to know the origin of the word `Pommie.' The famous war correspondent, the late Ashmad Barlett, in his book, `Despatches from the Dardanelles,' written at the time of the campaign, says that the term `Pommie' was applied by veteran troops of the campaign to newly arrived troops from Britain. Their fresh pink complexions were likened to the fruit pomegranate, in contrast to the bronzed features of the veteran troops. They were referred to as `Pommies.' The term, therefore, was not applied by Dominion troops in particular to those from Britain, but by veteran troops, both British and Dominion, to new arrivals. -KIWI. <i>(Jan 2, 1958,Christchurch Star-Sun,2</i>)

>  Sir, - In reply to O.J. Davis and `Very Interested' relating to the origin of the word `Pommie.' The word apparently came into being during the 1914-18 War and is derived from the French word pommes, meaning, I believe, potatoes. During the war the front line troops of the British Army were very seriously short of food, except for potatoes, on which they subsisted for many weeks. Hence on the fields at Flanders this peculiar and, I might say, very controversial word came into being. I am sure that any British World War I veteran could affirm this explanation.-W.J.BRACKS. <i>(Jan 4, 1958,Christchurch Star-Sun,2</i>)

>  Sir, - It is `POM-E,' not `Pommie.' These four letters originated in the old sailing ship days. Migrants leaving the British Isles were issued with a permit of migration certificate which was headed, `Permit of migration-Ireland,' `Permit of migration-England,' depending on the part of the British Isles one was from. The first letters in these four words `Permit of migration-England' are `POM-E,' spelt now, as pronounced then, `Pommie.' -SAILS. <i>(Jan 6, 1958,Christchurch Star-Sun,2</i>)

>  Sir, - The red coat of the soldier gave rise to the sailors' nickname for him of `Pommy,' a corruption of the French `pomme.' This derivation is far more likely than `Prisoner of Mother England.' The derogatory nickname would be more likely to stick to the guards than to the convicts. If my explanation is incorrect am I entitled to call our trans-Tasman cousins (and others) `Pommies?' - I am, etc., A PENSIONER OF MOTHER ENGLAND. <i>(Feb 23, 1962,Evening Post,8</i>)

>  Sir, - Unfortunately previous correspondents have been confused by the spelling of `Pommy.' I understand the correct spelling to be P.O.M.M.I.E., this being derived from the initial letters of the phrase, `People of Many Magnificient Immortal Epics.' This derivation was given in the Australian R.S.L. magazine several years ago. - I am, etc, DRONGATUS PONGORUM. <i>(1962,Evening Post</i>)

>  EVERY now and then some one puts forward a new theory on why Englishmen are occasionally referred to in these southern latitudes as `Pommies'. The following note from Mr. G.T.M., of the coastal motor vessel Squall, at Wellington, may clear things up: `I first visited Aussie in 1911-Western Australia, Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland. Immigrants were variously termed-Immygrant', `Jimmy grants', and up among the bananalanders, quite often `Pommy grants' (pomegranates). Very soon this became `Pommy'; and this, I think, would be the true derivation.' <i>(Sep 3, 1964,Dominion,4</i>)

Of course `Poor Jenny' or `Poor Sally', as it is perhaps better known, was and no doubt still is a girl's game. As I had three doting sisters I cheerfully joined their games when my boy friends were not looking. Remember the words of the song? Poor Sally is a-weeping, a-weeping, a-weeping, Poor Sally is a-weeping, On a bright summer's day. On the carpet she shall kneel While the grass grows in the field - Stand up, stand up, upon your feet, And choose the one you love so sweet. Then followed `the moment of truth' and with girl and boy standing demurely in the middle of the ring of children, the circle danced around them singing: Now you're married I wish you joy, First a girl and then a boy. I forget the final words, if any. Usually this game was followed by `Ring-a-ring a rosie, Pop down a posie.' Strange, though, how the love-making aspect would come into many of these old games. I must have been a pronounced `sheeler' about this time because I also remember joining in the singing of I sent a letter to my love And on the way I dropped it, Some of you have picked it up And put it in your pocket. Dropped it - dropped it! And so on. A year or two later at the mellowing age of 10 years I abhorred all these `sissy' games though I still had a hankering to play `Oranges and Lemons', even at the great age of 12. <i>(Jun 27, 1903,Diary</i>) [NOTES: (1903 June 27) Pat Lawlor Wellington Diary in 1977 Aug. 27 Dominion 6 June 27 1903]

>  <b>GUTHRIE-SMITH</b> In the early 'eighties occurred two dry seasons during which grass fires were run over the hot western and northern faces of certain portions on eastern Tutira; on the blackened ground then and once again seedlings of brome-grass (<i>Bromus mollis</i>) appeared in so great profusion that other grasses were temporarily submerged in hillsides of waving hay. [284] `Poor Pretences' was then the name by which this brome-grass was known on the east coast : it may be worth putting on record a suggestion as to how the plant came by such a curious designation. It was a `poor pretence' compared with ryegrass, cock's-foot, and white clover, the mixture sown then almost as a religious duty on Hawke's Bay runs, good and bad alike. So much for the sense; as regards the sound, `poor pretences' can, I think, only be a corruption of <i>Poa pratensis</i>; the Latin name of the one plant done into English has been fitted to another. The reader will recollect how this grass - more widely known as goose-grass - was sown wholesale over the trough of the run. <i>(1926,Tutira,283</i>)

>  <b>HUGHES</b> My old friend Kae Miller used to drive a gaily decorated van with "A Pride of Poozlers" inscribed on the side. My son Jonathan, who has driven that van, believes it was around in the early 1770. I am sure it was some time in the 70s. I have the impression, perhaps wrongly, that Kae invented the words poozle, poozling and poozler. Jonathan has the same belief but neither of us is sure if it is correct. She certainly used these words. Kae (single name Katrine Hursthouse), was a dedicated environmentalist,long before it was fashionable. Poozling was a part of her environmentalism.

In it the drill was rotated in the hole by swinging the machine handle backwards and forwards. At first the miners did not like it, as they considered it `shook up' the roof too much, causing falls of ground, but it was light and easily transportable and was fast in good ground. It remained in use in the stopes for many years, until the much later introduction of the rotary stoper.

## poppy show
 
 <i>n.</i> a girl's show of underwear [ca1950s (Kath Walls) ca 1930s DEH]

>  When I was a child, a well-used term for any female accidentally showing too much underwear was "poppy show" - just saying the two words ensured a rapid hitching of petticoat or smoothing of rumpled skirts. <i>(Jan 29, 1994,Listener (New Zealand Listener),56</i>)

>  <b>SUTTON-SMITH</b> For example, when a girl's dress blows in the air, boys will claim they have seen a `poppy show'. This is a widespread term. <i>(1953,Unorganized Games,2/665</i>)

>  <b>SUTTON-SMITH</b> Pin dips were also another popular amusement. `A pin or a bull or a button, To see a rary rary show show show!' (1875; Tahataki). A piece of glass backed by cardboard was covered with a piece of paper that could be flicked up to show the `rary rary show' or had a slit in it through which one could peep. One saw through the glass a variety of colors, pieces of colored paper, flower petals, pictures, and later pieces off cigarette boxes. Sometimes these had been arranged in some pattern, at other times they were kaleidoscopic only, and the perceiver had himself to add the configurations of intelligibility. The price for the view was always a pin `which we did not want anyhow but always accepted,' a relic from an age when such things were rare. Pin dips were known also as `poppy shows' (perhaps it was the similar flash of color that gave the same name - `the poppy show' - to the exciting experience of seeing a girl's dress blown upward by the wind; pins were not charged for flowers of this sort). In fact, the pin dip or the prick book may have developed from the poppy show. The poppy show was common before 1900 and the prick book after that date, a fact connected with the ever-increasing stock of picture cards and magazine pictures available to children. <i>(1981,History of Children's Play,223</i>)

## porch
 
 <i>n.</i> [Jim writes: The question is whether the <i>British</i> use of porch is also wider than the dictionaries suggest. The absence of the terms sunporch etc from these dictionaries may be significant. I have noticed two (apparently) wider uses in Humphrey Carpenter's biography of Tolkien p.246 - "Now they had time simply to sit and talk especially on summer evenings after supper, on a bench in the front pocrch of Sandfield Road." [This is interesting for the author's phrase <i>in the porch</i>, whereas we would normally say <i>on the porch</i>. Also in Ruth Rendell, <i>Harm Done</i> p. 213. A 1987 Midlands Property Supplement has porch only in the sense of entrance porch (and then seldom); one or two ads have the term <i>storm porch</i> which was new to me. (Although porch and verandah are partly interchangeable, I think that the covered entrance to a meeting house - whare tipuna, wharenui - is always in English "porch", although it extends for the full width of the building.)]

## poukai
 
 <i>n.</i> any of a round of annual hui attended by the Maori King (or, formerly, Queen) in Kingite territory [ORIGIN: Maori]

>  Home in Waikato, Tawhiao sought solutions to Maori problems through the establishment of Maori institutions to deal with them. In 1885 he initiated the institution of Poukai, where the King would pay annual visits to King movement marae to encourage people to return to their home marae at least once a year. The first Poukai (originally called Puna-kai, or 'source of food') was held at Whatiwhatihoe in March 1885. It was a day for the less fortunate to be fed and entertained. The Poukai developed into an event which would later ensure direct consultation of the people with the King. <i>(1993,Dictionary of NZ Biography,2</i>) [NOTES: from the DNZB entry on King Tawhiao (R.T. Mahuta) (updated online version 2007)]

Mr Eruera said the king was attending a poukai, or assembly, and this was the 44th year it had been held at Kokohinau. ... A copy of a publication celebrating the 44 years of the poukai being held at Kokohinau was also given to the king by Katerina Waiari. Teriaki Amoamo, on behalf of Whakatohea and Te Whanau-a-Apanui, presented a ceremonial hoe waka (canoe paddle).Mr Eruera said the open debate session, which is what a poukai is all about, raised a few issues. One of those issues was brought up earlier in the day by Whakatohea and Te Whanau-a-Apanui who requested to share the poukai in the future. Mr Eruera said the request would have to go to hapu members to consider.A restored flagpole was also erected - hapu members, under the direction of carver Graham Junior Niao, carried out the restoration on the carved pole - and the special poukai flag was flown. <i>(Jan 18, 2007,Whakatane Beacon,1</i>)

>  <b>McLINTOCK</b> In the constitutional debates of 1854 during the first session of the New Zealand Parliament, the term `Prime Minister' was frequently used in a somewhat casual fashion. This explains in part why it was some years before the term `Premier' came into general usage. William Fox (q.v.) who took office in July 1861, was described in the <i>Gazette</i> as Attorney-General `with first seat in the Ministry'. In November 1864 Weld (q.v.) was gazetted as holding `a seat in the Executive Council and the office of Premier'. Stafford (q.v.) his successor, in October 1865 was termed `First Minister'. In June 1869, when Fox again headed a Ministry, he was described officially as `Premier and member of the Executive Council.' Thereafter the term `Premier' was regularly used. Nevertheless, in the Schedule of the Civil List Act of 1873, provision was made for the salary of the Leader of the Government `being the Prime Minister'. The first Premier to use the title `Prime Minister' officially was Richard John Seddon (q.v.). It was used in the <i>New Zealand Year Book</i> of 1900 and the Imperial Conference of 1903 confirmed the practice. <i>(1966,Encyclopaedia of New Zealand, An,2/868</i>)

>  My wish is to see a proper use made of all the natural resources, and I would even go so far as for instance to use the pressure of the water, before it is supplied to the ships, or before a street is filled with it, to press wool, or do some other service on the wharf. <i>(May 27, 1880,Evening Post,3</i>)

>  My employment was chiefly in packing the woolbales which is very heavy work. You put from 90 to 120 fleeces in a bail which way [sic] from 300 to 350 lbs. It is hard to press the wool into so small a compass. We sheared some 850 sheep to-day. <i>(Nov 24, 1862,Chudleigh Diary,67,1950 ed.</i>)

>  `Press' and `sweep' are technical terms for necessary operations in the woolshed at shearing time. The former refers to pressing the fleeces into tight-packed bales ... to facilitate the transport of an otherwise bulky commodity. The latter is the process of keeping the floor (the `boards'), on which the sheep are shorn, clear of loose ends of wool, dirt and excrement. <i>(1945,NZ Geographer,1/39</i>) [NOTES: (Pascoe `Canterbury High Country')]

>  <b>WILSON</b> At the main entrance of the shearing-shed, which is a long building with pens down the centre, and an outlet at each end, stands a wool-press, and behind this are the bins into which the fleeces, after having been classed, are placed preparatory to being pressed. <i>(1894,In the Land of the Tui,242</i>)

The visitors found the country admirably adapted for sheep-farming, and they treated with some contempt the raw emigrants from England who looked to agriculture as the foundation of their fortunes. One of the visitors, who seem to have delighted in the soubriquet of `Shagroon', ventured to prophesy, in a letter, which found its way into print, that the `Canterbury Pilgrims' would soon be ruined and their country left for occupation by his more enlightened comrades. The `pilgrims' sought no harsher revenge than to nickname their Port Philip visitors `prophets' and to take example from their experience in pastoral pursuits. The Canterbury pasturage system was quickly adapted to the requirements of sheepfarming on a large scale, and `pilgrims' and `prophets' were soon merged into one class of Canterbury runholders. <i>(1866,Canterbury Rhymes,5</i>)

>  <i>Prophet</i>.- Nickname of the Australian squatters who came down to Canterbury in 185(1) They were caled Ps. because they prophesied ruin for the farming pilgrims.

>  Not only did Australian sheep arrive, but during the 1850-60 period many Australian squatters (disgruntled by the fickle rainfall) also sold or abandoned their properties and migrated to New Zealand. These men arrived with capital to invest, with experience in colonial farming, knowledgeable of the peculiar habits of the Merino sheep, and with whole-hearted support of a `squatting' policy of land tenure based on the occupation of large areas of grazing country at low rentals. They became known as the `Prophets' because they forecast failure for the small-area arable farm plans of the established settlements. <i>(1966,Encyclopaedia of New Zealand, An,3/231</i>)

>  Shortly the pilgrim and prophet agreed, The plough and the crook couldn't live far apart .. Quickly the prophet bred up his flock. As he defied dogs, scab and catarrh. <i>(1851,BLANK ENTRY,5</i>) [NOTES: in REEVES Canterbury Rhymes (1883)]

>  <b>THOMSON</b> An old Australian squatter, who visited the Canterbury settlement in 1851, divided the inhabitants into pilgrims, shagruns and prophets; the first were the original colonists, the second were people from other parts of New Zealand and the last were settlers from Australia. <i>(1859,Story of New Zealand, The,II 186</i>)
