## porch


 n. [Jim writes: The question is whether the <i>British</i> use of porch is also wider than the dictionaries suggest. The absence of the terms sunporch etc from these dictionaries may be significant. I have noticed two (apparently) wider uses in Humphrey Carpenter's biography of Tolkien p.246 - "Now they had time simply to sit and talk especially on summer evenings after supper, on a bench in the front pocrch of Sandfield Road." [This is interesting for the author's phrase <i>in the porch</i>, whereas we would normally say <i>on the porch</i>. Also in Ruth Rendell, <i>Harm Done</i> p. 213. A 1987 Midlands Property Supplement has porch only in the sense of entrance porch (and then seldom); one or two ads have the term <i>storm porch</i> which was new to me. (Although porch and verandah are partly interchangeable, I think that the covered entrance to a meeting house - whare tipuna, wharenui - is always in English "porch", although it extends for the full width of the building.)]

 n. an indeterminate sentence introduced by the Criminal Justice Act 1954 for offenders repeatedly convicted of certain crimes.

None of these terms is recorded in DNZE. Its scope has been protean. In its present form (Criminal Justice Act 1985 as amended) it is a sentence of indefinite detention with no fixed maximum that may be imposed on persons aged 21 or more convicted of certain sexual and other serious offences. A sentence under the same name existed in England from 1908 to 1967.]
