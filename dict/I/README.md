>  Mr Local Iwi objected, saying that nowhere in the rules did it acknowledge that entries could be written in te reo, and it was therefore a violation of human rights and a calculated insult to his ancestors, who invented the haiku, the sonnet, and the sewing machine, and who would gather beneath a misty mountain in days of old to (a full transcirpt of Mr Local Iwi's speech can be found on our website). <i>(Sep 21, 2002,Listener (New Zealand Listener),94</i>)

## iwi authority
 
 <i>n.</i> a person or people responsible for tribal governance or treasury.

>  Although the legislation would empower iwi authorities to lay designated bits of coastline out of bounds, he says it's not its intention. <i>(Feb 7, 2009,Listener (New Zealand Listener),5</i>)

>  Most Maori iwi (tribal) authorities will this year spend ... funds on administration costs. <i>(Oct 6, 1988,Dominion,1</i>)

## iwi tax
 
 <i>n.</i> (Environment) a conservation levy on commercial fishing and usage of some rivers and lakes, proposed by iwi owners.

>  An iwi tax is a second mini-Treaty settlement (March 6). Any cost to commercial fishermen is naturally tax-deductible, thus lessening the tax take. Taxpayers will have to make this up in some other way. <i>(Mar 14, 2009,Dominion Post,B4</i>)

>  It's obvious that the government doesn't have a problem with the iwi tax being levied on commercial use of Lake Ellesmere (March 6) and this attitude indicates there won't be much in the way of accountability for the revenue. <i>(Mar 14, 2009,Dominion Post,B4</i>)

>  Commercial users of the Waikato River should prepare themselves for an "iwi tax" after Ngai Tahu imposed a conservation levy on eel fishermen at Lake Ellesmere in the South Island. Mr Smith described the levy as the forerunner to a new nationwide iwi tax system after his group of eel fishermen were asked to contribute $29,000, or 8 per cent of the total annual eel fishery earnings of $360,000, to Ngai Tahu for Lake Ellesmere environmental restoration purposes. The iwi also receives revenue for leasing out its quota. <i>(Mar 6, 2009,Internet - see Notes,1</i>) [NOTES: www.stuff.co.nz/waikato-times/news/2011399/Iwi-tax-fears-for-Waikato-River]

## iwitocracy
 
 <i>n.</i>
