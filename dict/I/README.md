For example, 1845 EJ Wakefield Adventure NZ, with ref. to ca1841-2 uses immigrant rather more often than emigrant (eg 2/437). For a fanciful, rhyming var., see Jimmygrant. cf also 189? Hutchinson's Australian Encyclopedia 158 The term immigrant is generally applied in Australasia to persons whose passages have been inwhole or part paid by the state. cf. also OED 1809 Kendall Travels Immigrant is perhaps the only new word, of which the circumstances of the U.S. has in any degree]
