This is the graceful little `Kahawai-bird' or `Sea-swallow,' which pursues schools of small surface fish, wheeling, darting and dipping to the water, in its energetic quest of food. Since the Kahawai fish is predaceous on the small school fish also, the tern is an excellent indicator of the presence of Kahawai.

Quote: The principal trees are the ronkaterra and the cowry, which grow to an immense height without a branch, and are of such magnitude as to be fit for the masts of large ships. The ronkaterra is found in marshy grounds and on the banks of rivers; it appears to be an ever-green, and bears a red berry.

Quote: When in a hurry, or feeling orthographically tired, he [the southerner] calls the big manuka `kaikatoa.' A southern Maori once said to me:- `We did not pronounce the word manuka like some northerners who throw the accent forward and say `man-u-ka,' nor like the bushmen, who say `m'nooka,' but about halfway between these two pronouncing each part clearly as mah-nook-a.' Unless my hearing deceives me this throws the emphasis on the central syllable while leaving the first syllable clearly pronounced. it is a remarkable fact that while the manuka is so common its name is so seldom used in the composition of place-names.

They resemble a pipi in shape,though they possess a black horny covering - the periostracum - like a marine mussel. Kakahi once formed extensive beds in New Zealand lakes and rivers, living shallowly buried in sand or mud, like pipi, rather than attached to rocks in the manner of most marine mussels.

Definition: <i>karaka</i> is the chief modern name among New Zealanders; others are obsolesc.

Early spgs (<i>cracker, kraka</i>) point to these pronunciations; even as accurate an observer as E. J. Wakefield would spell it `kraka' (perhaps [krak a]), although in his `Adventures in NZ' it is always written <i>karaka.</i> cf <i>cracker, caraceer;</i> a spreading tree common in coastal areas and producing orange fruit, the kernels of which are poisonous unless soaked and cooked [Maori]; cowtree, New Zealand laurel (kopi, Chatham island).

Definition: The word in this sense appears only in Torlesse's writings from Cant., the second 1849 form if genuine represents an uncertain hearing of Maori [r]. The plant denoted would seem to be rather the BUSH LAWYERT than MATAGOURI, and if so may represent a hearing of a *<i>karamoa</i> form of <i>taramoa</i> `lawyer' parallel with<i> karamea / taramea</i> `spear grass'. If it denotes <i>tumatakuru,</i> it perhaps represents an idiosyncratic hearing of the final- <i>kuru. </i>

Quote: ``Kauri Silk', generally in the form of plaited strands representing the long tresses of blonde hair often seen on young girls of the period, appeared during this time. ... `When a plait was made, often up to five feet long in finished form, it was tied with a ribbon and bow, top and bottom, and coiled in a suitable box, and offered for sale, or entered in any suitable exhibition competitions. ... To produce a nice specimen it is essential to have a good piece of gum. it would require to weigh about two pounds, [26] so that it could be firmly gripped, and should be pale and clear, and free from ruptures and defects. This seems to be difficult to acquire in these days. The lump must be scraped and cleaned and dried. ... `With an old metal frypan or an old metal plate on the hot range, moved about to get just the right temperature, the lump of gum was pressed on to the plate until the surface melted, and was then slowly drawn out to arm's length or further, and as this was done, the melted surface miraculously came away in these beautiful drawn fibres, which were placed on the nearby table. The operation was completed [sic: ? repeated] until the required three bundles of strands were produced. These were plaited with a standard three-plait. The conditions of the old-time warm and humid kitchen were very necessary for the success of this process, as the gum fibres when cold are very fragile.

Quote: <i>Butterfish</i> A small family (Odacidae) of Australasian shallow- water, weed dwelling and eating fishes, sometimes called kelpfishes or weed whitings. internationally the name butterfish is used for the family to which our warehou belong, but in New Zealand the name is so firmly associated with the species described below that a change is unlikely. <i>ibid.</i> 111 The name kelpfish is loosely used. in New Zealand it is used for one of the species described below [Chironemus marmoratus] and describes the other [Aplodactylus arctidens, Marblefish] in terms of its habitat. it is also used for some greenish wrasses.

The Kelsos are a composite of Finn and Texel on a Coopworth-Romney base, with a dash of East Friesian. Starting by mating Finns to his Coopworth-Romneys, and then adding Texels and a small number of East Friesians, it took him five years to develop the Kelso. in all, 11000 Kelso ewes are spread across six farms.

Quote: Chamber sets had to be well anchored in the country and heavy bearers inserted beneath them to carry the `keps' or chairs on which the cages were placed when winding trucks of ore from the level. The legs supporting the first set above the level would be about ten feet high. <i>ibid. </i>316 <i>`Clips", "keps", or landing chairs</i>: A solid, dead flush, landing platform for the cages was required at each level and at the surface for getting full trucks in and out of cages. This platform was provided by a steel frame mounted on heavy bearers two or three feet below the level of the chamber floor so that it could be tilted into the shaft by a lever and make a strong support beneath the cages. it was balanced by a counterweight to make it easy to operate.

Quote: To ensure that the two cages in the shaft worked exactly opposite each other when the chamberman `changed gear' to wind ore from a different level, he rang the change signal of five bells on the steel-wire knocker-line suspended in the shaft compartment, and the engine-driver placed the `free' cage on the surface `clips' (or `keps") and disengaged it on the engine drive-shaft. The chamberman then signalled to lift the `fast' cage on the level where he was working just clear of the clips, and pinned these back clear of the shaft. He entered the `fast' cage and rang the number of the level to which he wished to change, and was taken there by the driver. On arrival at the level he placed the clips in position in the shaft and rang the change signal, whereupon the driver placed the `fast' cage on the clips and put the `free' cage (which was sitting on the surface clips) in gear on the engine drive-shaft. Thus, when the cage was raised from the level to the surface, the cage from the surface would be exactly at the level from which the winding was taking place. Great care had always to be taken to ensure that the clips were not left protruding into the shaft as a serious accident could result if the cage crashed into them.

A private letter (1896) say - `You will hear any day at a Melbourne bar the first man say <i>Keora ta-u</i>, while the other says <i>Keora tatu,</i> so replacing `Here's to you!'. These expressions are corruptions of the Maori, <i>Kai ora taua</i>,' `Health to us too!' and <i>Kia ora tatou</i>,' Health to all of us!'

Quote: in Tom's early years at Puketiti, anything up to forty axemen were employed. They usually worked in gangs of four, and a gang would sometimes scarf for a full week before they let the `King' tree go. The procedure was to work `drives'. Depending on various factors, a certain defined area would be `scarfed', i.e. each tree in that area would have a scarf cut in it to the point where it was about to fall, and when the whole of that particular area was completed the `King' tree would be felled. This tree, specially selected for the purpose, would be so situated that, as it fell, it would take two or three of the scarfed trees with it. They in turn would do the same, and so on, and the whole area would fall almost as one. This is known as working a drive, and saves a tremendous amount of axe work.

Quote: There is much confusion in the common names applied to New Zealand fishes, and the application of the name `Hake' to several distinct species of our fishes, is a good example of that confusion. in Blenheim, Nelson, Picton and Wellington, a very different fish, scientifically known as <i>Rexea solandri</i>, and closely related to the Barracouta, with obviously no affinities to the Cod family, is called `Hake' or `Southern Kingfish'. The name Hake applied to this fish is entirely wrong, as it belongs to the Snake Mackerel family, the <i>Gempylidae</i>. The other name, `Southern Kingfish', is more appropriate, although it suggests affinities with another family of fishes, which are associated in New Zealand with the name of `Kingfish', namely the Carangidae or Trevally (occasionally spelt Trevalli) family, which includes the `Yellowtail' or `Kingfish' (<i>Regificola grandis</i>).

Quote: The Kingites, as the Waikatos styled themselves, were so called on account of their having set up for themselves a King... 6 (Griffiths Collection) The Kingites, as the Waikatos styled themselves, were so called on account of their having set up for themselves a king. Their reigning potentate was Tawhiao, son of their first king, old Potatau, who died a short time before this period. The idea of having a king, or the king movement, was started by Wiremu Thompson, one of the leading Waikato chiefs, who was afterwards called `the King-maker'. <i>ibid.</i> 9 The Kingites, as the Waikatos styled themselves, were so called on account of their having set up for themselves a king.

Quote: But the most interesting of all the team games was a small group game variously known as <i>Cunning Joe</i> (K-6), Cunny, Conjure, Conjo, Cunny Joe, and Cronje. in this game the cat [a thin 6-inch stick with pointed ends] was sometimes called the Cunning Joe stick (Waikouaiti, Otago, 1900) or the kip (Dunedin, 1895). it was a game for four players. Two rings were marked on the ground a short distance from each other with a square drawn in the middle of each. A boy armed with a short stick stood at each ring, a bowler behind him. One of the bowlers tossed a short piece of wood at the ring opposite. The striker hit it as hard as he could, then both boys ran as in cricket.

Quote: `i believe that the member for Tarawera is referring to the possum (Trichosurus vulpecula), not opossums (genus Didelphis) which are American marsupials,' [Agriculture Minister Moyle] said in his written reply. ... And for the name, you can be forgiven if you call our imported possum (the `brushtail possum,' to be precise) an opossum. The Aussie possum - there are about six types across the Tasman - looked so much like the American counterpart when first discovered by Europeans that it was called an opossum. As recently as 1981, scientists who turned up for the first New Zealand symposium on marsupials ... were sagely talking about possums in 12 of the papers presented while their colleagues talked about opossums in six papers. All were referring to the same nocturnal nuisance. One of the great achievements of that symposium was to finish up talking the same language after taking a vote that favoured for possum. ... The fur trade is pushing for `NZ phalanger' (a generic name for a group of marsupials) while possum stew exporters are trying to win acceptance for `Kiwi bear' in Oriental restaurants.

See: cf. Digger, Anzac

Notes: WW2 usage is rare in this sense and seems applied as a descriptive term by outsiders rather than used by NZ troops themselves: early in WW2 used as distinct from Digger (rather appropriated by Australians) and WW1 Anzac. Possibly first applied by non-New Zealand units, and adopted as appropriate, as a noun, as an attributive and (occas.) as a term of address. Often humorously pronounced [kaiwai], perhaps in imitative guying of American pronunciations.

Quote: To have shepherded the now famous all-soldier `Kiwis Revue' through an Australian tour which began in April, 1946, and to finish up with the company smiling, successful and intact in 1950 is no mean achievement. This responsibility has been that of Terry Vaughan, the Kiwis Producer and Musical Director. However, it is no new task to him, having been with the Kiwis ever since their inception in the Middle East in 1941 when the 2nd N.Z.E.F. formed its own Entertainment Unit with men of the Division. Sir Bernard Freyberg, V.C., now His Excellency the Governor General of New Zealand, has always kept a paternal eye on his `Kiwi Concert Party'.

Then a long length of cotton was attached to the smaller piece and led away to the gate. The cotton was pulled every now and then and the button tapped against the window. it was nighttime, and folks would pull up the blind and peer out. Some more adventurous spirits would come out and investigate and would maybe get entangled with the cotton. Then the culprit would run away to some other house. (1900; Moeraki)

There were generally two players ... who each sought to deflect the point of the pocket knife from certain parts of the body by a flick of the hand in such a way that the blade would stick firmly into the ground. ... Every movement had to be done three times. [172] Typical movements were: (1) Place the open pocket knife (loose) [name of movement] [sic] on the closed knuckles of the right hand, point the knife towards the thumb, then with a quick upward flick of the hand to the left, deflect the point of the knife into the ground.

Quote: The sheep they shore were not so well woolled on the belly and carried less wool on the points than they do now, so that fewer short blows were required to take off the trimmings; but the shears they used were one inch and a half shorter in the blade and, being joined by a single instead of a double bow, required a wrist of iron to drive them continuously throughout a summer's day. A piece of raw hide known as a knocker is now used to prevent the shears clashing when closed, but before this was introduced the clack and snap of steel meeting steel was a noise inseparable from any busy shearing shed.

When a boy lost all his marbles at play he was `scat' [?related to skint ?HWO] . ... A `ringer' was a taw which, when fired at the commencement of the game, lodged in the track of the ring itself; that, and knocking a marble out when he `fired' were the perfect shots. ... To fire a shot while holding the hand nearer to the ring than where the taw had lain, was to `funk', an unforgiveable crime.

Also in use was the `jogger' a cartlike vehicle with two pneumatic-tyred wheels, seating about three people and drawn by two horses attached to a shaft. They worked on the principle of the African Cape Cart. The pole (shaft) was attached to the collars of the horses. Tom McClurg of Te Whakuru made the first `jogger' in Chathams, about 1940.

Notes: the fruit of the Fuchsia excorticata; often mistakenly applied to the tree itself (more properly kotukutuku); an error poss. reinforced or compounded by the entries in early Williams Dictonary: for the tree not the berry is not in the 3rd 1871 edition (check earlier editions): possibly the common error started with the mistaken entry in the 4th edn 1892, corrected in the 1917 (1921) 157 to Fruit of <i>Fuchsia excorticata (kootukutuku</i> is in all edns from 1871 correctly glossed).

Quote: in Otago the general name of the [flax] plant, as a whole, is `Korari,' - or as metamorphosed by the settler, pronounced and spelt `Koura<i>d</i>i,' [a-macron] or `Cora<i>d</i>i' [a-macron]. The same term is applied in the North island equally to the whole plant, and to the dried flower-stem when cut for rafts or other purposes; or exclusively to the flower-stalk. in the North [83] island, the Flax-plant is also known as `Harakeke,' or `Herekiakia,' - its usual name there. ... The lower part of the flower-stem is `Kaikaha;' the outer part of the leaf `Parakoka;' [a1, o-macron] the refuse of the leaf `Hunga-hunga;' the flax, dressed or not, or scraped fibre, manufactured from the leaf, `Whitau,' or `Muka.'

They were still alive, and so numerous that they formed a stratum three or four inches thick, to walk over which was as if one trod on new-fallen snow. The `kouraraki' are fed on by the whale; and their appearance early, and in abundance, was hailed as the prognostic of a good season.

Quote: <i>ku[u]mara</i> is the spelling of the name of this tuber, and this has been the spelling in the <i>Journal of the Polynesian Society</i>, for instance, from its first volume in 1892 to the present day. it has more than one been suggested that the tuber first came from Peru, and this is fully discussed in <i>Journal of the Polynesian Society</i>, vol. 54 (1945), 175, where the point is made that the northern Quichua-speaking people of Peru and Ecuador have the sweet potato and know it under the names kumar, komal, and kumal, which names have as counteraprts in Polynesia the terms kumara in Newzealand (Maori), Rarotonga, the Tuamotus, Mangareva, and Easter island; umara and umaa in Tahiti; kumala in Tonga, 'umala in Samoa; uala and uwala in Hawaii; with kumaa in the Marqueses; and ku'a'ra in Mangaia. Remembering the "l" and :r: interchange in some of the dialects, and remembering the dropping of letters as indicated by hamzah, it seems evident that the form kumara represents all these different forms: seeing, too, that in none of them is the median "a" replaced by "e," there seems to be no doubt that the correct spelling is kumara and not kumera. in Williams' <i>Dictionary</i>, ku[u]mara is the main entry: there is an entry kumera, but is no more than a reference; ku[u]mera = kumara.

Quote: (W.J. Elvy `Maori History') Much has been writted concerning the so-called pit [387] dwellers, who formerly inhabited the district. When Europeans commenced to settle in the Sounds the bush had practically established itself to the water's edge. The few vestiges of aboriginal cultivation were rapidly becoming clothed with a dense second growth and, except for a few localities occupied by the remnants of native tribes, had been practically obliterated. As the colonists commenced to clear the bush, despite the fact that on their land were large forest trees that had apparently taken centuries to grow, vestiges of an ancient occupation were brought to light in the shapes square or oblong pits. These pits were of varying shapes and sizes, many bunched into steep spurs and forming a series that reached from the shores to the tops of the low hills, and all placed in secure positions on land not liable to slip. These numerous pits were widely scattered throughout the Sounds and, some being similar to those in use in the North as store pits, they were called by the settlers' `Kumera pits' under the impression that they had been used to store those tubers for food supply. investigation proved this idea to be erroneous; the pits were found in positions unsuitable for such storage and the presence of shell heaps amongst them proved that they had formed part of the dwellings of an ancient people.

No trace of pig of any species has been excavated from archaic sites in this country.... The kunekune pigs are likely to have been brought to New Zealand by the Chinese coming to the goldmines of central Otago and for that reason as a special breed are well worthy of preservation.

Quote: it wasn't always like this, though - why, when i think back to the times we rode many miles over the hills to gather kai moana to supplement our everyday diet. There were paua, kutai, and kaura, big and red, when they were in season. This entailed a whole day's journey, and more often than not we stayed half the night also, netting for fish at the narrows of the bay. We would return home with our pihau bags laden heavy with shellfish and fish. The fish, mostly mullet, were sorted, cleaned, gutted and then smoked. Fat plumpy kutai were shelled and bottled.
