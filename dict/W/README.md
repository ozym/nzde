 <i>n.</i> a confederation of iwi ["Maori iwi are usually grouped into confederations, which are named after ancestral canoes (i.e.waka) which are said to have come from Hawaiki. The best known are Tainui and Arawa, but there are others (and I can't help noticing the recent term for Northland confederation is Tai Tokerau which is not a canoe). The use arises because traditionally a Maori might have a number of iwi affiliations. (I was once told that when asked their iwi in the Muruwhenua area, locals tend to look down at the ground and give the iwi in whose rohe they are standing, because they belong to all the Muriwhenua iwi). Thus the waka in the quotations [in <i>Kotare</i>]presumably refer to the notion of waka as confederations - which is not a bad way to think of political parties. And waka jumping is I take as heinous as announcing you are Arawa rather than the Tainui you once proclaimed (in the middle of a battle). (Brian Easton, 12/12/1999)]

(Oct 10, 1873 -- ,Wanganui Herald,2)

>  Whatever the merits of the Wakefield theory of colonisation, it is certain that the first attempts to carry them into practice were made as if by 'prentice hands - indeed, the most fixed and reliable feature of the arrangements seemed to be the price charged for the land - namely, aGBP1 per acre at Wellington and New Plymouth and 30s at Nelson.

>  <b>MUELLER</b> His Honour the Superintendent has ... been pleased to appoint you an Assistant Surveyor & Mining Surveyor at Westland, ... (May 2, 1866 -- ,My Dear Bannie,164,1958 ed.)

>  <b>MAY</b> `West Coast' continued to be used in the 1860's, but after 1864 the official names, `West Canterbury' and `Nelson South West', had some popular currency. Then a further complication was introduced. In 1859 John Rochfort had had coined the name `West land', a shortened form of `Westmoreland', the name he used on a map showing his West Coast explorations. After August 1865 the form `Westland' was resurrected and was used both for electoral and judicial districts which covered part or whole of the West Coast. Popularly, however, `Westland' was used chiefly for West Canterbury; the remainder of Canterbury Province was sometimes called `Eastland'. West Canterbury became the County of Westland in 1868 and the Province of Westland five years later. The Nelson South-West Goldfield kept this official name until 1876 when the provinces were abolished. (1967 -- ,West Coast Gold Rushes,14,1962 ed.)

>  <b>MAY</b> `West Coast' remains the popular term for the strip of country on the wrong side of the Southern Alps, though recently New Zealand geographers have adopted `Westland' for the whole West Coast. Whatever its merits, this term is unsatisfactory. It has some popular currency south of Greymouth, and it may acquire popularity through its teaching in the schools; but at an indefinable point north of Greymouth one is likely to be told, `This isn't Westland, this is the Buller'. A region itself so distinctive is also marked by strong local feeling. In 1960 `Westland' celebrated its centenary; `the Buller' did not. (1967 -- ,West Coast Gold Rushes,15)

If these diggings offer a larger profit to those who strike the right spot, they have the disadvantage, that the necessary labour is hard and unhealthy, for the diggers must often stand breast-high in the cold water from the mountains. ... The dry diggings, which generally require more capital and strength, are to be found mostly on the heights or in the higher diluvium. The water must often be brought long distances in sluices. The earth containing the gold is thrown into the sluices, in which a double floor with numerous bored openings lie.

>  "Each individual comes under group pressure to assert their acceptance of the group values by joining in anti-women behavour," Phillips says.

It's the "whaddarya?" mentality, he says, citing the famous line from Greg McGee's play <i>Foreskin's Lament.</i>" (Feb 22, 2004 -- ,Sunday Star Times,A8)

>  The play was a lament for the innocence of a lost small-town rugby culture, nowhere more powerful than in the concluding (and very theatrical) "lament" - a long monologue wherein Foreskin poured out his misery, his inability to cope with his lost sense of self. The final words were the cry "Whaddarya? Whaddarya? Whaddarya?", as eloquent an interrogation of our notions of masculinity as New Zealand literature has produced.... Maybe the original play (and especially its conclusion) was just too theatrical to be filmed. Or maybe somebody should ask Greg McGee if he's an insightful commentator on New Zealamnd mores, or a purveyor of bland entertainments of "international" (that is, nowhere) appeal. Whaddarya?

>  Whaddarya? - a question that has entered our cultural lexicon. A signifier of an unsavoury side of New Zealand male behaviour on and off the footy field. It was the catchcry of a young man called Foreskin in Greg McGee's play <i>Foreskin's lament</i>. (Jul 31, 1999 -- ,Listener (New Zealand Listener),37)

>  <b>McGEE</b> I'm hanging up my boots - whaddarya? / Kicking for touch - whaddarya? / Chucking it in - whaddarya? Kicking it in the guts / shimmying away on the blind-side / just ... couldn't ... hack it... / Whaddarya? / Whaddarya? / Whaddarya? ... (1981 -- ,Foreskin's Lament,96)

They were black and smooth in the hair as the mole of the Old Country, and were esteemed delicacies. They were always mischievous, but the Norway rat that came with the white man was worse. He began by killing and eating his aboriginal congener, and then made it more difficult than ever to keep anything eatable out of reach of his teeth. Human ingenuity, however, is superior to that of most of the lower animals, and so the `futtah' came to be - a storehouse on four posts, each of them so bevelled as to render it impossible for the cleverest rat to climb them.

## wheelie bin
 
 <i>n.</i> a large refuse bin on wheels [I suspect wheelie-bin appears to be Oz but Can-Plan being a local trade-name is NZ. The only American words that come near I can find are trash can and garbage can but I would still suspect that it was the Americans who first put them on wheels, probably in California where they have longer drives than in New York. The Oxford Dictionary of New Words (1991) has it as "a large refuse bin on wheels; a Eurobin. The wheelie bin first appeared in the UK about 1986, but both the object and the name seem to have been used in Australia for some years before that". However, the only Oz dictionary I could find it in was Macquarie 3rd edition, no quotes, no dates but it gives as alternative names "Otto" or "Otto bin" and "Sulo" or "Sulo bin", both being trade-names a la Can-Plan. In our street where every second person is on Can-Plan, we tend now to say "The neighbour has got his can-plan out". The Yellow Pages for Wellington give a number of variants : handikarts, wheelie carts, daily karts, care carts, handcarts, wheely bin, wheelibin. **OED online: 4. Special Comb. wheelie bin orig. Austral., a large refuse bin on wheels.]

The head is very small, and the beak like that of a hawk, thus imparting somewhat of an accipitrine character to this anomalous owl.

With such curt alliteration, it doesn't matter that what's in contention is actually a complex educational, socio-economic and racial issue. It has miraculously been reduced to the limits of the number of letters an <i>Evening Post</i> headline writer can squeeze into a front-page banner, which number also equates to the newspaper's collective IQ. So what the hell is `white flight' anyway? According to race relations conciliator Wally Hirsch, it's that startling new phenomenon of honky parents taking their kids away from schools whose rolls have significant numbers of different-tinted folk. -->1986 May 23 Dominion 14 Sir, - Much has been said about the `white flight' from Maori schools. I assure you this is not new. When we lived near Rotorua in the 1960s, people of Pakeha descent would pay to send their children miles to school, rather than send them to schools with a predominantly Maori roll.

>  In a <i>Sunday Star</i> special report, Mrs Russell and Mr Shallard talk about `white flight' - pakeha parents avoiding schools with high Maori and Pacific Island rolls or removing their children from such schools in favour of ones with predominantly Pakeha rolls. (Jun 15, 1986 -- ,Sunday Star Times,A1)

>  The Race Relations Conciliator ... has aroused much controversy since he coined the phrase `white flight' to describe parents of European - as opposed to the offensively racist and discriminatory term Pakeha - ancestry moving their children to schools where due emphasis is placed on values the majority of New Zealanders still adhere to. (Oct 4, 1986 -- ,Listener (New Zealand Listener),8)

## white grub
 
 <i>n.</i> (See [grass grub](../G#grass-grub))

>  There are twenty-eight native species belonging to the genus <i>Odontria,</i> but all observers agree that the principal grass grub is <i>Odontria zealandica.</i> In the larval stage this is known as `grass grub,' `white grub,' or `curl grub,' and the adult stage is known as `grass grub beetle,' `brown beetle.' or `turnip fly.' (1943 -- ,NZ Journal of Science & Technology,23/306A)

>  All the attention of agriculturists is now turned to the destruction of the white grub or worm that is neither more nor less than the larva of the cockchafer, that great favourite of schoolboys, but in reality one of the most mischievous insects of the temperate zone, and capable of committing as much havoc as the locust in warm climates. (Feb 28, 1867 -- ,Bruce Herald,7)

>  The cure also acts admirably against the white grubs that destroy the roots of grass on lawns, and has been very successfully tried upon some valuable lawns. (Jan 7, 1892 -- ,Otago Witness,5)

>  Probably the warm days account for the beetle of the "white grub" (Odontua striata, is it not?) being found on the wing in numbers. (Aug 4, 1909 -- ,Otago Witness,85)

>  The grass-grubs are the larvae of the cockchafer beeter, a Cawthron Institute bulletin points out, and are sometimes known as white grubs; these larvae are very easily recognised by the characteristic manner in which they lie doubled up in the ground. (Dec 18, 1936 -- ,Evening Post,5)

At various times these young people were referred to as `Teddy Boys', `Milk Bar Cowboys' and `Bodgies and Widgies'... [2] Bodgies and Widgies are members of a closely knit sex cult. This cult is centred and operates actively in Australia (and especially in Sydney). As far as is known, the cult itself does not operate in Christchurch, though [3] many boys and girls imitate its fashions and share with its adherents an interest in jive. The dress of these youngsters resembles that of the Teddy Boy and Girl, but is not so immaculate; hair is worn long and brushed back, without the characteristic Teddy Boy tuft; behaviour tends to be more boisterous and `attention provoking'. In this report such phrases as `Teddy Boy style' or `Bodgie type' are used purely as descriptive terms, to indicate certain fashions of dress which show these overseas influences.

>  <b>ARNOLD</b> The skipper ... was a French Canadian. There were three men besides, one an old whaler, another a native of Nova Scotia, the third ... [from] the Azores ... [We] entered Queen Charlotte's Sound. By this time the wind had increased to a gale from the North West, and blowing over the low ridge which divides the Sound from Port Gore, it came to us in `williwaws', that is, violent puffs, succeeded by temporary calms. You can see the Williwaw coming from a long distance; the sea is blown up in a cloud of spray; curling and whirling it sweeps down upon you, and immediately before it comes, `Let go,' shouts the skipper, and the fore and main sheets are let go, blocks rattle, masts strain, canvas flaps violently, and the weight of wind forces the vessel nearly on her beam ends. Then in half a minute it is nearly a dead calm. (Nov 22, 1848 -- ,Letters,157) [NOTES: (Marlborough Sounds)]

Sometimes, crossing the mouth of a bay, we caught these gusts full and were well-nigh drenched. ... In Wellington I was assured that `willy waugh' was a Scotch word, also that it was a corruption from the Maori `wirriwa', which I later found did not exist. On my return to my dictionaries in Melbourne, I found the word in the Standard as Patagonian. `Willi-wa, a violent wind from mountains in the fiords of Patagonia'. An this be true (and I can find no more about it), by what process, through what book, did the word pass from Patagonia to Queen Charlotte Sound? The `willi-waught' of `Auld Lang Syne' means a draught of liquor, a long drink, not a sprinkling of wet externally. (1901 -- ,TrNZI,33/504) [NOTES: (Professor E.E. Morris) [corrected 28/1/90]]

>  <b>HENRY BRETT</b> Then the diary goes on to duly chronicle the daily round of life aboard, one uncommon thing noted being the old sailoring custom, now a thing of the past, of `working off a dead horse.' The name is derived from the fact that in those days a sailor had a month's wages advanced to him before leaving Port. As he invariably spent it, he called the first four weeks at sea `working off a dead horse', and the end of the term was signalised by the heaving overboard, with muchceremony, of an effigy of the defunct equine.

>  <b>BUCKLEY</b> The passing of the first month [at sea in the Westminster in 1842] brought the sailors' ceremony of `burying the dead horse'. When engaged, the men received one month's pay in advance to enable them to outfit themselves. Few would have much left, so for the first month they felt themselves to be working for nothing, or `working a dead horse' which must now be buried. An equine effigy was placed on a wooden frame with four wheels, and amid loud singing was drawn around the deck three times by sailors dressed as policemen bearing staves of sailcloth filled with straw, hats of the same material and whiskers and long wigs of white yarn. The `horse' was put up for auction (the money being for liquor afterwards) and was then hoisted to the main yard-arm mounted by a sailor, during another chorus. Duly hoisted with this ceremony the `horse' was set alight by a long squib, the rope was cut, and the `poor oldman' (as the song went) fell into the sea. Thus was the dead horse buried. [Possibly from William Harris's MS Journal of a voyage; or John Newland diary from 1841.] (1983 -- ,Of Toffs and Toilers,58)

>  .. `dead horse' should have been in because the time that had to be worked off for an advance pay not only meant a lot to the sailors coming out here, but was transferred to our mining life to signify the overburden which had to be stripped before paydirt could be reached.

>  Working off a dead horse is never a pleasant operation, either to a corporation or an individual. (Jun 10, 1889 -- ,Evening Post,3)

>  We are not going to deny it, but we should like to point out that we have been working off our dead horse during the past five years of unostentatious advance.
