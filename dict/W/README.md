(Auckland  Star,2)

>  <b>Oct 4, 1864</b> These causes of delay might be borne with more patience if the diggings were somewhat richer than any of those hitherto opened in this part of the country, but on tucker, or small wages ground, people do not bear such disappointments with a very remarkable degree of christian [sic] fortitude.

 <i>n.</i> a confederation of iwi ["Maori iwi are usually grouped into confederations, which are named after ancestral canoes (i.e.waka) which are said to have come from Hawaiki. The best known are Tainui and Arawa, but there are others (and I can't help noticing the recent term for Northland confederation is Tai Tokerau which is not a canoe). The use arises because traditionally a Maori might have a number of iwi affiliations. (I was once told that when asked their iwi in the Muruwhenua area, locals tend to look down at the ground and give the iwi in whose rohe they are standing, because they belong to all the Muriwhenua iwi). Thus the waka in the quotations [in <i>Kotare</i>]presumably refer to the notion of waka as confederations - which is not a bad way to think of political parties. And waka jumping is I take as heinous as announcing you are Arawa rather than the Tainui you once proclaimed (in the middle of a battle). (Brian Easton, 12/12/1999)]

>  <b>1870</b> (Bathgate) One of these [strange insects found in Otago] is the `walking-stick' of the colonists, which is an apterous insect, belonging to the order <i>Orthoptera </i>and the tribe Phasiuma [Phasma]. It derives its name from an extraordinary resemblance to a twig. (TrNZI,3/138)

>  <b>1871</b> The application of the word `Phasiuma' to the insect commonly called the `walking-stick' is probably an error of the printer. It should be `Phasma', and the hyphen placed between `walking' and `stick' should be omitted - the common name having been given from its resemblance to an animated twig, and not (as the hyphen would suggest) from any resemblance to a stick we use in walking.

If the sheep were hot- water washed, their owner had to build an expensive apparatus. The remains of these <i>sheep washes</i> were not uncommon twenty years ago. If there were technical terms for this process they are not recorded here, except that the most important place was at the spout. Everybody used to get very wet. (Early Canterbury Runs,391)

But scoured wool took a good deal of time - the bales were carted to the washpool, the wool washed, dried and turned in the open - wind and rain stopped work frequently'. `There was a `wash' and a drying paddock at both Longlands and Haldon; the pool was fed by a race which had to be cleaned out before each shearing and kept in repair ...'

>  <b>1967</b> <i>MAY</i> `West Coast' continued to be used in the 1860's, but after 1864 the official names, `West Canterbury' and `Nelson South West', had some popular currency. Then a further complication was introduced. In 1859 John Rochfort had had coined the name `West land', a shortened form of `Westmoreland', the name he used on a map showing his West Coast explorations. After August 1865 the form `Westland' was resurrected and was used both for electoral and judicial districts which covered part or whole of the West Coast. Popularly, however, `Westland' was used chiefly for West Canterbury; the remainder of Canterbury Province was sometimes called `Eastland'. West Canterbury became the County of Westland in 1868 and the Province of Westland five years later. The Nelson South-West Goldfield kept this official name until 1876 when the provinces were abolished. (West Coast Gold Rushes,14,1962 ed.)

>  <b>1967</b> <i>MAY</i> `West Coast' remains the popular term for the strip of country on the wrong side of the Southern Alps, though recently New Zealand geographers have adopted `Westland' for the whole West Coast. Whatever its merits, this term is unsatisfactory. It has some popular currency south of Greymouth, and it may acquire popularity through its teaching in the schools; but at an indefinable point north of Greymouth one is likely to be told, `This isn't Westland, this is the Buller'. A region itself so distinctive is also marked by strong local feeling. In 1960 `Westland' celebrated its centenary; `the Buller' did not. (West Coast Gold Rushes,15)

If these diggings offer a larger profit to those who strike the right spot, they have the disadvantage, that the necessary labour is hard and unhealthy, for the diggers must often stand breast-high in the cold water from the mountains. ... The dry diggings, which generally require more capital and strength, are to be found mostly on the heights or in the higher diluvium. The water must often be brought long distances in sluices. The earth containing the gold is thrown into the sluices, in which a double floor with numerous bored openings lie.

It's the "whaddarya?" mentality, he says, citing the famous line from Greg McGee's play <i>Foreskin's Lament.</i>" (Sunday Star Times,A8)

>  <b>Nov 30, 2003</b> The play was a lament for the innocence of a lost small-town rugby culture, nowhere more powerful than in the concluding (and very theatrical) "lament" - a long monologue wherein Foreskin poured out his misery, his inability to cope with his lost sense of self. The final words were the cry "Whaddarya? Whaddarya? Whaddarya?", as eloquent an interrogation of our notions of masculinity as New Zealand literature has produced.... Maybe the original play (and especially its conclusion) was just too theatrical to be filmed. Or maybe somebody should ask Greg McGee if he's an insightful commentator on New Zealamnd mores, or a purveyor of bland entertainments of "international" (that is, nowhere) appeal. Whaddarya?

Whakamaa most often occurs for Maori people, either as individuals or as members of a group, when they are placed in a situation where they perceive themselves to be at a disadvantage and thus to have a lower status. Whakamaa, therefore, has a lot to do with mana, which is most often translated by Maori people to mean power or authority... Third, utu or making amends requires restoring a person's or group's mana.

They were always mischievous, but the Norway rat that came with the white man was worse. He began by killing and eating his aboriginal congener, and then made it more difficult than ever to keep anything eatable out of reach of his teeth. Human ingenuity, however, is superior to that of most of the lower animals, and so the `futtah' came to be - a storehouse on four posts, each of them so bevelled as to render it impossible for the cleverest rat to climb them. The same expedient is to-day in use on Stewart Island and the West Coast in fact, wherever properly constructed buildings are not available for the storage of things eatable or destructible by the rodents in question.' ... ][Futtahs are today in use on Stewart Island and the West Coast. - (Southland Daily News)

## wheelie bin
 
 <i>n.</i> a large refuse bin on wheels [I suspect wheelie-bin appears to be Oz but Can-Plan being a local trade-name is NZ. The only American words that come near I can find are trash can and garbage can but I would still suspect that it was the Americans who first put them on wheels, probably in California where they have longer drives than in New York. The Oxford Dictionary of New Words (1991) has it as "a large refuse bin on wheels; a Eurobin. The wheelie bin first appeared in the UK about 1986, but both the object and the name seem to have been used in Australia for some years before that". However, the only Oz dictionary I could find it in was Macquarie 3rd edition, no quotes, no dates but it gives as alternative names "Otto" or "Otto bin" and "Sulo" or "Sulo bin", both being trade-names a la Can-Plan. In our street where every second person is on Can-Plan, we tend now to say "The neighbour has got his can-plan out". The Yellow Pages for Wellington give a number of variants : handikarts, wheelie carts, daily karts, care carts, handcarts, wheely bin, wheelibin. **OED online: 4. Special Comb. wheelie bin orig.

Think about it, talk it out, see and hear how it rolls off your tongue. Doesn't matter what it means or involves or entails - the two-word phrase is the attention-grabbing winner of the year. With such curt alliteration, it doesn't matter that what's in contention is actually a complex educational, socio-economic and racial issue. It has miraculously been reduced to the limits of the number of letters an <i>Evening Post</i> headline writer can squeeze into a front-page banner, which number also equates to the newspaper's collective IQ. So what the hell is `white flight' anyway? According to race relations conciliator Wally Hirsch, it's that startling new phenomenon of honky parents taking their kids away from schools whose rolls have significant numbers of different-tinted folk. -->1986 May 23 Dominion 14 Sir, - Much has been said about the `white flight' from Maori schools. I assure you this is not new. When we lived near Rotorua in the 1960s, people of Pakeha descent would pay to send their children miles to school, rather than send them to schools with a predominantly Maori roll.

(Sunday Star Times,A1)

>  <b>Oct 4, 1986</b> The Race Relations Conciliator ... has aroused much controversy since he coined the phrase `white flight' to describe parents of European - as opposed to the offensively racist and discriminatory term Pakeha - ancestry moving their children to schools where due emphasis is placed on values the majority of New Zealanders still adhere to. (Listener (New Zealand Listener),8)

>  <b>1956</b> <i>CROWTHER</i> During the early months of this year [1956] much publicity was given in the Christchurch newspapers to the fact that large numbers of young people were to be seen, especially at the weekends, in the central areas of the city. These young people congregated in the streets and milk-bars. Many of them had motor-cycles ... At various times these young people were referred to as `Teddy Boys', `Milk Bar Cowboys' and `Bodgies and Widgies'... [2] Bodgies and Widgies are members of a closely knit sex cult. This cult is centred and operates actively in Australia (and especially in Sydney). As far as is known, the cult itself does not operate in Christchurch, though [3] many boys and girls imitate its fashions and share with its adherents an interest in jive. The dress of these youngsters resembles that of the Teddy Boy and Girl, but is not so immaculate; hair is worn long and brushed back, without the characteristic Teddy Boy tuft; behaviour tends to be more boisterous and `attention provoking'. In this report such phrases as `Teddy Boy style' or `Bodgie type' are used purely as descriptive terms, to indicate certain fashions of dress which show these overseas influences.

Galvanic energy possessed various players. The Number 4 began running along the back of the lineout. The halfback of the day kept pace with him. Other forwards, 2, 3 and 5, tailed after him. Number 6 or number 7 tensed and poised and made ready to spring into the air to touch, tap or grab and pass the ball down into the arms of the first runner. And within seconds, the whole pack was shambling in his wake into the the [sic] open field, ... This was `Willie Away', a favourite ploy of the 1963-64 All Black Rugby Union team from New Zealand while they were on tour of the British Isles, France and British Columbia between October 1963 and the end of February 1964.

You can see the Williwaw coming from a long distance; the sea is blown up in a cloud of spray; curling and whirling it sweeps down upon you, and immediately before it comes, `Let go,' shouts the skipper, and the fore and main sheets are let go, blocks rattle, masts strain, canvas flaps violently, and the weight of wind forces the vessel nearly on her beam ends.

This seems to me a commoner meaning for <i>boo-ay</i> than `backblocks', `remote rural districts', mentioned by Keith Sinclair, in the <i>Pelican History of New Zealand</i>, with suggested derivation from the settlement at Puhoi. Since the backblocks are already called the <i>woop woops</i> (the form given by Partridge who says it is mainly restricted to New South Wales: I know the word but think of it as <i>wook wooks), the sticks, the tea tree</i> and <i>the cactus</i> some semantic differentiation is not impossible.

When engaged, the men received one month's pay in advance to enable them to outfit themselves. Few would have much left, so for the first month they felt themselves to be working for nothing, or `working a dead horse' which must now be buried. An equine effigy was placed on a wooden frame with four wheels, and amid loud singing was drawn around the deck three times by sailors dressed as policemen bearing staves of sailcloth filled with straw, hats of the same material and whiskers and long wigs of white yarn. The `horse' was put up for auction (the money being for liquor afterwards) and was then hoisted to the main yard-arm mounted by a sailor, during another chorus. Duly hoisted with this ceremony the `horse' was set alight by a long squib, the rope was cut, and the `poor oldman' (as the song went) fell into the sea. Thus was the dead horse buried. [Possibly from William Harris's MS Journal of a voyage; or John Newland diary from 1841.] (Of Toffs and Toilers,58)
