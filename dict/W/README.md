The term winebox inquiry was first used of the Parliamentary Select Subcommittee on Finance & Expenditure when it began looking into the matter and was later transferred to the Davidson High Court (Cook Islands) Commission. When faced with a court writ on publication, the Independent ran a fable on a mythical country called [South] Wogistan in which the basic details were revealed. The term Wogistan is said by the Independent in last week's issue in a column by Chalkie (? Berryman) to have gained some currency in circles interested in the Winebox affair and may be worth picking up - I have the references. It's very PC. The first published use of the term wine box of documents may have been made by Paul East in Parliament [NZPD, p. 539]

n. a confederation of iwi
> "Maori iwi are usually grouped into confederations, which are named after ancestral canoes (i.e.waka) which are said to have come from Hawaiki. The best known are Tainui and Arawa, but there are others (and I can't help noticing the recent term for Northland confederation is Tai Tokerau which is not a canoe). The use arises because traditionally a Maori might have a number of iwi affiliations. (I was once told that when asked their iwi in the Muruwhenua area, locals tend to look down at the ground and give the iwi in whose rohe they are standing, because they belong to all the Muriwhenua iwi). Thus the waka in the quotations [in <i>Kotare</i>]presumably refer to the notion of waka as confederations - which is not a bad way to think of political parties. And waka jumping is I take as heinous as announcing you are Arawa rather than the Tainui you once proclaimed (in the middle of a battle). (Brian Easton, 12/12/1999)

n. a large refuse bin on wheels
> I suspect wheelie-bin appears to be Oz but Can-Plan being a local trade-name is NZ. The only American words that come near I can find are trash can and garbage can but I would still suspect that it was the Americans who first put them on wheels, probably in California where they have longer drives than in New York. The Oxford Dictionary of New Words (1991) has it as "a large refuse bin on wheels; a Eurobin. The wheelie bin first appeared in the UK about 1986, but both the object and the name seem to have been used in Australia for some years before that". However, the only Oz dictionary I could find it in was Macquarie 3rd edition, no quotes, no dates but it gives as alternative names "Otto" or "Otto bin" and "Sulo" or "Sulo bin", both being trade-names a la Can-Plan. In our street where every second person is on Can-Plan, we tend now to say "The neighbour has got his can-plan out". The Yellow Pages for Wellington give a number of variants : handikarts, wheelie carts, daily karts, care carts, handcarts, wheely bin, wheelibin. **OED online: 4. Special Comb. wheelie bin orig.

> My thoughts were that the word sounds Scottish (willy-wombles etc) (or Scottish via Newfoundland whalers) but it doesn't turn up in any Scottish or Newfoundland Dictionary I have seen.

One of your cits suggests Patagonian but no Patagonian dictionaries around. Meteorological dictionaries ignore it although they touch on willy-willy. Otherwise, it is just one of their unspecified "local winds". However, the attached dictionary entry seems to have a lot of sense, particularly the statement that it was common 18th Century oral nautical usage, to which can be added "preserved in some of these localities where these winds occur. dhurley 11/25/1999
