There was slots, there was lumps, there was packing fragies in bottlos, there was the tying down of the north line for a clearance, the scissors, lead seals and squeezers. The sorters on call-back flicking circulars with precision. The volcanoes of letters on the facing-up table, the checker chanting the reds onto the lorry, the checker calling the overseas in, London 45 ... The queue of men working at the parcel depot or the postal siding ... Tieing down the cargon. ... The sorters' school at the posties' pub known colloquially as Box 44 or the B.B.C., the Back Bar of the Cecil. The cheerful abuse of cobbers (Pagan Game, The,85)

>  <b>1944</b> <i>CARTER</i> Next to the X class. is the Z class, orwhat are often referred to as theCornwall Cup boats. They owe theirexistence to a small band of Takapunayachtsmen who planned the first boat,with much the same idea in their minds asdid George Honour when he built the firstof the 14-foot square bilge boats,namely, low first cost, ease ofconstruction, and an ever-watchful eye onspeed and performance under Aucklandharbour weather conditions. The yachtswere originally designed for the TakapunaBoating Club but owing to theirpopularity from the outset the type wasquickly adopted by many other yacht clubsthroughout New Zealand...

>  <b>Jul 1983</b> Alert has a Z-code system for drivers and phone room staff. In theory it saves time on the airwaves -- in practice many of the old time drivers are sceptical of speaking in z's.

Translation: The despatch has asked driver one-eightparked on the Oxford rank to do a job for which there is an order number. He's to collect 12 parcels from the Central Post Office and take them to the Totalisator Agency Board Karangahape Road! (Strict translation of z 4 is `non passenger'). There is also a special z code number meaning `possible attack on driver' - if a driver radios to base that `this looks like a z' - everyone hears is on the alert. (Metro,25: 81)

Some observers, however, noted small numbers of one species in Milford Sound in 1832. New Zealand birds are rarely gregarious, but the <i> Zosterops </i> made a great migration, in large flocks, from the South Island to the North Island in 1856, and the Maori name for the bird is `The Stranger' <i> Tau-hou </i>). Nevertheless, Buller thinks that the species (<i> Z. caerulescens </i> is indigenous in New Zealand. (See under <i> Silver-eye </i>, quotation 1888.) (Austral English,525)
