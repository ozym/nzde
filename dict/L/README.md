## launders


 n.
## laundry


 n. a room in a house used principally for washing and (since the advent of clothes dryers) drying clothes and linen. [Jim writes : In relation to places this is much the most common use of the word in NZ. Not in DNZE or - in this sense - NZPOD but recognised in NZ Oxford Paperback. NSOD defines <i>laundry</i> as an establishment where clothes etc are laundered, Collins as a place where clothes and linen are washed and ironed, which encompasses the NZ use but is unspecified. In most modern houses in England clothes are washed in the kitchen and there is no separate room. In NZ until recently bylaws prohibited washing clothes in a room used for preparing food. <i>Laundry</i> is known in England in the NZ sense but seems uncommon. In a 1987 Property supplement to a Midlands newspaper it rarely appeared in the detailed house descriptions and always as an attributive - <i>laundry area, laundry room</i>. The term <i>laundry room</i> appears in Ruth Rendell, <i>Harm Done</i> 2000. The Australian situation (and word) was similar to the NZ one according to Hudson <i>Modern Australian usage</i>. MAU p223. Macquarie 1981 is consistent with this. Salmond <i>Old NZ Houses</i>p. 200 suggests that the change of name from wash-house to laundry was associated with the advent of the bungalow style i.e. c1910-1920. Cf <i>porch</i>. But see <i>wash-house</i>. The same book implies (anachronistically?) a possible much earlier use "Until the 1880s... water was heated... in the laundry copper for washing clothes and for the children's weekly bath." p. 143. Two house plans (<i>Ibid.</i> p. 198-99) are of interest. One dated 1930 has a "washhouse" under the same roof as the house; the other dated 1924 has a basement "laundry".]
