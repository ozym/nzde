>  <b>May 12, 1952</b> The fame of the West Coaster's `own' garment for outdoor workers - the ubiquitous miner's `lammie' - has spread far afield. This week a trial parcel of lammies was dispatched on request to members of the Malayan Police Force at Singapore who indicated in a letter to the Kumara firm which has made a specialty of supplying lammies since the gold rush days that they had heard of the unique qualities of the garment. The full story of the request from Singapore is not known, but it is believed that Auckland Chinese market gardeners may have been responsible. For many years Chinese gardeners have adopted the lammie as almost an `official uniform' and supplies for Auckland are regularly forwarded from the small business in Kumara. But what is a lammie? In the first place it is a strictly utilitarian garment with no claims to attractiveness in appearance. The original type - still in use after 70 years - was a loose-fitting almost shapeless shirt buttoned in front and with elbow-length sleeves made of flannel and water-proofed. It is this proofing quality which has established the popularity of the lammie. It was an ideal garment for outdoor workers in the West Coast climate, enabling them to keep drywithout the encumbrance of an overcoat and it was soon in general use on the gold fields, later to be adopted by bushworkers, navvies and many farmers. At first the lammie was made of moleskin, then grey flannel and over the past 20 years of navy flannel, but the proofing formula has remained unchanged. In recent years there has also been developed a modified style, double breasted Coast fashion, but the original shirt style is still popular. Apart from the fact that the historic gold-mining town of Kumara is regarded as the home of the lammie in New Zealand, the story of its origin has been lost. It is thought, however, that it was probably brought to the goldfields by the first Welsh diggers and that it may have been spelt `Llamy.' It was soon almosta universal garment among diggers, including big contingents of Chinese miners who found it ideal both for utility and for economy. (Evening Post,9)

>  <b>May 1952</b> [corresp. col.] Sir, - In reference to your article on the West Coast shirt called a `lammie,' when a girl over 58 years ago I used to visit a couple named Tait who lived in Dillsmanstown. Mr. had a sluicing claim, and a draper named Todd used to get special flannel by the bolt for Mrs. Tait, and she made these `lammies.' She waterproofed them by dipping them in a special solution two or three times and hanging them on a line dripping wet, to dry each time. They were sold for 2 [pounds] 10/- to 2 [pounds] 15/- but I'm sure she never sold one to a Chinaman. There were hundreds there working tailings. It was Mrs. Tait's own invention I am sure. - I am, etc., (Evening Post,13)

## landing chair
 
 <i>n.</i> [goldmining]

>  <b>1978</b> <i>McARA</i> `Clips', `keps', or landing chairs: A solid, dead flush, landing platform for the cages was required at each level and at the surface for getting full trucks in and out of cages. This platform was provided by a steel frame mounted on heavy bearers two or three feet below the level of the chamber floor so that it could be tilted into the shaft by a lever and make a strong support beneath the cages. It was balanced by a counterweight to make it easy to operate. To ensure that the two cages in the shaft worked exactly opposite each other when the chamberman `changed gear' to wind ore from a different level, he rang the change signal of five bells on the steel-wire knocker-line suspended in the shaft compartment, and the engine-driver placed the `free' cage on the surface `clips' (or `keps') and disengaged it on the engine drive-shaft. The chamberman then signalled to lift the `fast' cage on the level where he was working just clear of the clips, and pinned these back clear of the shaft. He entered the `fast' cage and rang the number of the level to which he wished to change, and was taken there by the driver. On arrival at the level he placed the clips in position in the shaft and rang the change signal, whereupon the driver placed the `fast' cage on the clips and put the `free' cage (which was sitting on the surface clips) in gear on the engine drive-shaft. Thus, when the cage was raised from the level to the surface, the cage from the surface would be exactly at the level from which the winding was taking place. Great care had always to be taken to ensure that the clips were not left protruding into the shaft as a serious accident could result if the cage crashed into them.

>  <b>1898</b> <i>MORRIS</i> The word has various shades of meaning between a playful youngster and a blackguardly rough. Little street-boys are often in a kindly way called little larrikins. (See quotations), 1870 and 1885.) Archibald Forbes described the larrikin as `a cross between the Street Arab and Hoodlum, with a dash of the Rough thrown in to improve the mixture.` (`Century.') The mostexalted position yet reached in liteature by this word is in Sir Richard Burton's Translation of the Arabian Nights' (1886-7), vol. i. p. 4, Story of the larrikin and the Cook; vol. iv. p. 281, Tale of First Larrikin. The previous translator, Jonathan Scott, had rendered the Arabic word, Sharper. -->There are three views as to the origin of the word, viz.-->(I) That it is a phonetic spelling of the broad Irish pronunciation, with a trilled rof the word larking). The story goes that a certain Sergeant Dalton, about the year 1869, charged a youthful prisoner at the Melbourne Police Court with being ` a-larrr-akin' about the streets.` The police Magistrate, Mr Sturt, did not quite catch the word- `A what, Sergeant?` -`A larrikin', your Worchup.` The police court reporter used the word the next day in the paper, and it stuck. (see quotation, `Argus,' 1896.) This story is believed by 99 persons out of 100: unfortunately it lacks confirmation; for the record of theincident cannot be discovered after long search in files by many people. Mr Skeat's warning must be remembered - -->`As a rule, derivations which require a story to be told turn out to be false.` -->(2) That the word is thieves' English, promoted like swag, plant, lift, etc., into ordinary Australian English. Warders testify that for a number of years before the word appeared in print, it was used among criminals in gaol as two separate words, viz. leary('cute, fly, knowing), and kinchen(youngster), `learykinchenshortened commonly into `leary-kin' and leary kid'. Australian wardens and constables are Irish, almost to a man. Their pronunciation of `leary kin' would be very nearly `lairy kin,' which becomes the single word larrikin. (See quotation, 1871.) It is possible that Sergeant Dalton used this expression and was misunderstood by the reporter. (3) The word has been derived from the French larron (a thief), which is from the Latin latronem (a robber). This became in English larry, to which the English diminutive, kinwas added; although this etymology is always derided in Melbourne. (Austral English,259)

## laundry
 
 <i>n.</i> a room in a house used principally for washing and (since the advent of clothes dryers) drying clothes and linen. [Jim writes : In relation to places this is much the most common use of the word in NZ. Not in DNZE or - in this sense - NZPOD but recognised in NZ Oxford Paperback. NSOD defines <i>laundry</i> as an establishment where clothes etc are laundered, Collins as a place where clothes and linen are washed and ironed, which encompasses the NZ use but is unspecified. In most modern houses in England clothes are washed in the kitchen and there is no separate room. In NZ until recently bylaws prohibited washing clothes in a room used for preparing food. <i>Laundry</i> is known in England in the NZ sense but seems uncommon. In a 1987 Property supplement to a Midlands newspaper it rarely appeared in the detailed house descriptions and always as an attributive - <i>laundry area, laundry room</i>. The term <i>laundry room</i> appears in Ruth Rendell, <i>Harm Done</i> 2000. The Australian situation (and word) was similar to the NZ one according to Hudson <i>Modern Australian usage</i>. MAU p223. Macquarie 1981 is consistent with this. Salmond <i>Old NZ Houses</i>p. 200 suggests that the change of name from wash-house to laundry was associated with the advent of the bungalow style i.e. c1910-1920. Cf <i>porch</i>. But see <i>wash-house</i>. The same book implies (anachronistically?) a possible much earlier use "Until the 1880s... water was heated... in the laundry copper for washing clothes and for the children's weekly bath." p. 143. Two house plans (<i>Ibid.</i> p. 198-99) are of interest. One dated 1930 has a "washhouse" under the same roof as the house; the other dated 1924 has a basement "laundry".]

>  <b>1995</b> <i>ELDRED-GRIGG</i> I led her down the passage and into the kitchen, then through the kitchen and into the laundry. (Mum,43)

>  <b>1986</b> <i>SALMOND</i> The very names of the rooms suggested a different lifestyle - "living room" for parlour, "breakfast room" for dining room, "kitchenette" for kitchen (now combined with scullery), "laundry" for washhouse. (Old New Zealand,200)

In a superior way they stood aloof from the rest, and their attitude was one of opposition. ... No quarter was given, no consideration shown on either side. The advent of the beneficent constitution finally ended these bickerings ... and though the term `Little Enemy' clung long, it was rather as a memory than a badge.

## loaf
 
 <i>n.</i> In esp. NI towns, the standard `loaf' size was usually the two-pound, with a half-loaf being a pound. In country districts, esp. in the South Island, the standard loaf size was usually four-pound; with a half-loaf, two-pound, and a quarter-loaf, one pound. `Tourists' and holiday makers from towns were and are often thus confused when ordering country bread: the town's `half' was the country's `quarter' loaf.

>  <b>1980</b> <i>LELAND</i> <i>bread</i>: It comes in standard-sized loaves (government regulation). 350g (about 12 oz), 500g (about 1 lb), 700g (about 1 and a half lb). Unfortunately, common parlance for these loaves differs between the North and South islands. Many of the 700g loaves are made like a camel with two so that they can conveniently be split in half. Usually, if you ask for a loaf in the South Island it is one of these two humps (350g) that you get. In the North Island, if you want the same amount of bread (350g) you must ask for a half loaf. The other thing about bread, is that in this land of abundant food, where restaurant servings are usually generous, it is very hard to get more than one piece of bread (or one roll). Unlike North America, where they seem to hope you will settle for smaller servings if you fill up with bread, in New Zealand restaurants appear afraid that you will spoil your appetite with the stuff.
