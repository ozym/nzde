(Manners & Customs of the NZers,1/170)



## tai pari

 <i>n.</i> with TAI PARI perhaps indicative of the change in time and place of Pakeha vernacular knowledge of Maori Williams 361 <i>Tai (i) ... Sea.: timu `ebb(ing)'</i> (he tai timu<i> `low water'); pari</i> `flowing (of the tide)'. Both were intelligible to many English speakers up to at least the 1930s, and possibly the 1950s in the North Island, as witness the following joke first heard by me as a child in Havelock (South Island) possibly from an original King Country version; and first mentioned as early as 1845 by Walter Brodie in <i>The State of New Zealand </i>where it is attributed to Mr [?initial] Williams. Tim and Paddy were walking along the beach when they came across two Maoris arguing, as it semed to them, ferociously. One was crying out `Tie Tim!' and the other, `Tie Paddy!'. Paddy took to his heels shouting: `You can bloody well tie Tim if you like, but I'm damned if you'll tie Paddy!' Enjoyment of the joke depends not only on knowing the meaning of the Maori forms, but also on a non-Maori perception of Maori /r/ as [d], and failure to hear a devocalised /u/ final. In 1986 it is usually necessary to `prepare' the joke with tedious explanation.

There is considerable dispute as to whether the word is true Maori or not. The Rev. T. G. Hammond of Patea says - -->`No such Maori word as taipo, meaning devil, exists. It would mean evening-tide - tai-po. Probably the early sailors introduced attached meaning of devil from the Maori saying, `Are you not afraid to travel at night?' referring to the danger of tidal rivers.' -->On the hand, Mr. Tregear says, in his `Maori Comparative Dictionary,' s.v. - -->`Taepo, a goblin, a spectre. C.f. <i>tae</i>, to arrive; <i>po</i>, night.' The Rev. W. Colenso says, in his pamphlet on `Nomenclature' (1883), p. 5 - -->`Taepo means to visit or come by night, - a night visitant, - a spectral thing seen in dreams, - a fancied and feared thing, or hobgoblin, of the night or darkness; and this the settlers have construed to mean the Devil! - and of course their own orthodox one.'

Yours the morning tide, mine the evening tide, meaning You pass with the morning tide, as I will pass by the evening tide). The saying was often used in war, when a man saw a young relative or friend slain; and the words were often prophetic of his own fate. The meaning is quite destroyed if the last two words are run together - taipo instead of tai po: that results in the word under discussion, making the meaning: You pass on the morning tide, while I go to the devil! - naturally a modern interpretation. A Pakeha using the expression once confused that last words and made them taepa; when it meant: You pass on the morning tide, while I get over the fence.

The yachts were originally designed for the Takapuna Boating Club but owing to their popularity from the outset the type was quickly adopted by many other yacht clubs throughout New Zealand... From small beginnings the Takapuna one-design class rapidly expanded. (Little Ships: NZ's Yachting Fleet,127)

## tamarillo
 
 <i>n.</i> (formerly in New Zealand called tree tomato) a bright red, subtropical fruit grown on a small tree. [pl. -os]

>  <b>Jun 12, 2004</b> The tamarillo, it seems, is still a fruit New Zealand has largely to itself, for though it is grown in private gardens around the world in warm frost-free places like California, South Africa, Asia and Africa, only here is it cultivated systematically on a commercial scale... In the 1880s, Mr D Morris, director of the Botanbical Gardens in Jamaica, sent seeds to the hill districts of India and Sri Lanka, and it was from northern India that the first seeds were sent to New Zealand, to Hay and Sons, nurserymen of Parnell in Auckland. The Hay's 1891-1892 catalogue states that the nursery then had "plants of strong and healthy appearance" for sale... The name "tamarillo" officially came into being on January 31, 1967, after New Zealand exporters decided a more romantic, exotic name was needed than "tree tomato". The strategy worked, and today tamarillo seems to have become the accepted name internationally. (Dominion Post,E8)

>  <b>Jun 1982</b> He cites the economic potential of the pepino on a par with the tamarillo. (Orchardist NZ,143)

>  <b>Feb 1967</b> On February 1, 1967, the name tamarillo officially replaced tree tomato. (Orchardist NZ,23)

>  <b>1985</b> <i>BURTON</i> A native of the Andean region of Peru and of southern Brazil, the tamarillo is the only one of the 30 species of its genus, Cyphomandra, to be widely known...It was from northern India that the first seeds were sent to New Zealand, in 1891, to D. Hay & Sons, nurserymen of Parnell, Auckland. (Delectable Fruits Cookery,145)

>  <b>Sep 11, 2003</b> The Sex Kitten uses perfectly ripe tamarillos, blended with homemade vanilla sugar syrup and extra vanilla scraped from the pod, strained and frozen into ice cubes. (Dominion Post,D1)

>  <b>Apr 1991</b> Although it sounds Spanish, the name 'tamarillo' is another New Zealand invention. The former name 'tree tomato', was considered inappropriate for use overseas where people buying the fruits for the first time might expect them to taste like tomatoes. In 1967, orchardist Bill Thomson took the Maori word 'tama' added 'tillo' (taken from tomatillo, a complete unrelated Mexican fruit) and then (just to make the sound more mellifluous) he replaced 't' with an 'r'. Thus, 'tamarillo' was born. (NZ Geographic,58)

>  <b>1982</b> Supplies of tropical fruits were curtailed because of the Japanese threats to the sea lanes, and tamarillo (or tree tomato as they were then known) growing began in earnest. [WWII] <i>Ibid.</i> 141 An uncultivated native of the Andes region of Peru, the tamarillo is also found wild in India, Sri Lanka and parts of South East Asia. It was from the hilly regions of northern India that New Zealand's first seeds came, introduced by the Auckland nursery of D. Hay and Sons in 1891. At first only the yellow and purple varieties were grown and it was not until the end of World War I that the now almost universal red variety was bred at Mangere, Auckland. (Two Hundred Years of NZ Food & Cookery,31)

>  <b>1985</b> Two well-known New Zealand exports, neither of them native, are tree-tomatoes and Chinese gooseberries, but neither is called that by the exporters. The tomatoes are a South American fruit, a rich source of vitamin C and long popular in New Zealand. About twenty years ago, the name <i>tamarillo</i> was deliberately contrived, much as a brand name is. On the basis of <i>tomato</i>, a diminutive<i> -ill-</i> was added; then <i>tomatillo</i> was altered, in honor of a legendary Maori tribal hero, Tama-te-kapua, to <i>tamatillo</i>; and then a change to <i>tamarillo</i> was considered more euphonious. And so a new word was born. (Verbatim,2/11) [NOTES: (G.W.Turner)]

At that cry all the `in' players raced for home, and all the `out' players emerged from their hiding places and attempted to tag them. If all the `in' players could get home without being tagged, then the person seen (Tommy Jones), was considered captured, and he had to come and sit in the home base, And so the `in' team went on trying to sight players and [53] then get home without being tagged.

## tenure review
 
 <i>n.</i> (Rural) an exchange of some Crown-leased land for conservation purposes, for freehold title to the remainder of a leased property.

>  <b>Jul 12, 2003</b> It's called "tenure review", an unremarkable term for a remarkable transformation now taking place in our legendary South Island high country. In exchange for giving up the scenic and uneconomic parts of their land for a massive conservation estate, pastoral lease holders get freehold title to the rest of their property. [18] Currently, the main way of achieving it [sc. taking land for the conservation estate]is known as tenure review; a huge land swap inside the pastoral leases that make up 20 percent of the South Island and 10 percent of New Zealand. (Listener (New Zealand Listener),16)

>  <b>Jun 2007</b> When Jim Morris of Ben Avon Station entered tenure review, he did it with an open mind, prepared to move with the times and embrace the consequences. (Conservation Action,17)

>  <b>Jul 26, 2003</b> High-country farmers are quietly opting for tenure review because many are likely to become wealthy from what is [7] one of the best real estate deals in New Zealand in the last 50 years... I suspect that history will judge tenure review as not such a great idea for farmning or the public... What should have happened is a careful review of the pastoral lease system to maintain this unique form of land tenure, with adjustments to assist farmers to diversify and to protect uneconomic land. (Listener (New Zealand Listener),6)

>  <b>2007</b> <i>Relph</i> After six years about two-thirds of the 300 pastoral leases in the South Island have passed through or are undergoing tenure review. (From Tussocks to Tourists,144)

>  <b>Oct 9, 2004</b> Tenure review is a voluntary process for owners of high-country leases who may trade off areas of high conservation value to the conservation estate in return for freeholding the rest of their farms. (Listener (New Zealand Listener),17)

When I was a boy I heard sheep called `jumbucks,' an Australian aborigine term for them, but with the decease of ex-Australian stockmen the word has gone out of use now. Another term brought over from Australia was `maimai,' for a rough shelter from the weather. It was said to be a name for a blackfellow's camp, which I have always seen spelt `miamia,' and which is called `gunyah' or `wurley,' etc., by some tribes. We now apply the name to shooting shelters.

Finally I ran it to earth in a seven-volume Century, published back in 1891, which gave it as `A short violent downpour of rain in connection with a thunder-storm (Rare),' and produced a 19th century quotation. Perhaps we didn't hear it much in Invercargill in my younger days because thunderplumps are pretty uncommon there; but a colleague who came from Winton certainly knew of it; and it was even noised abroad by the Canterbury English. ...

The word has been explained as of convict origin, that the rags were used to soothe the galling of fetters; but the explanation is not satisfactory, for the part galled by the irons would not be the toe, but the ankle. A writer in `Truth' has cleared up the word (see quotation). It is of Maori origin. Away from Maoriland "toe-rigger' had no meaning, and a false meaning and origin were given by the change of vowel. (Austral English,472)

>  <b>May 6, 1911</b> Wonder how bookmakers came to be known as `Tommies"? `Tommy [sic] is short for Tommy Rook, and probably it was owing to `rook' sounding something like "book' that caused some wag to term him as such. A rook would apply to some bookmakers, but where does the `Tommy' come in?

## tonguer
 
 <i>n.</i>

>  <b>1941</b> <i>BAKER</i> The now obsolete term <i>tonguer</i> was also in use in the early 1830's, and very likely before it although I have discovered no written records of it prior to 1836. A tonguer was a native or white living in New Zealand who assisted a whaling crew to cut up whales and who also acted in the capacity of an interpreter. These men earned their name not from the act of interpreting, but from the fact that they were given the whale's carcase and tongue to dispose of as they wished. (NZ Slang,13)

>  <b>Apr 28, 1835</b> <i>CAPT JOY</i> ... it was told to me by our toungers [sic, at Cloudy Bay] that the cost [of a shore-hut] was trifling. ... I left them [sc Maoris] Came [sic] on board and despatched the boat the other side for a linguist our tounger. (The Ships all employ Tonguers [sic] and it is a general custom I have acceded on the same terms as others) On his arrival we opened the Subject but they [sc Maoris] were ashamed and finally settled that they would build the house. ... I must not omit here Some mention of what are called tonguers. they [sic] are here 2 and 3 white people who have a boat and some natives on a ship arriving they repair on board to solicit the Job for the ship The terms are that they occasionally furnish a crew to help tow whales they furnish a boats crew to help cut the whale in and do any talking for the captain whose ignorance of the language requires their aid in any matters with the natives. When the whale is cut in they are entitled to the carcass and the tongue which in plentiful Whaling is always left on the carcass and they contrive to get for [sic] 6 to 8 barrels of oil from each carcass but they are in general Blackguards and no dependence can be put in them - Runaways from Ships Mostly. [McNab's ed. fn] The Americans had ... to rely to a great extent upon Maori labour and to be indebted to the services of interpreters. These men were locally [?Cloudy Bay] called `tonguers'. ... In `The Piraki Log' [1911] the word `tonguer' is suggested as a corruption of the Maori `tonga'. This is quite wrong. The tonguer was a man who interpreted and assisted in cutting up and who was paid with the tongue of the whale.[choose between this and following citation???] (Log of Mary Mitchell) [NOTES: 1836 Apr 28 Capt.

>  <b>1840</b> <i>JOHNSON</i> After the ships had cut off the blubber ... the carcase was towed on shore by a crew of men, who call themselves `tonguers'. These men take off what little blubber the ship's crew have passed over, and also take out the tongue and try it all out. (Plain Truths,60)

>  <b>1843</b> <i>DIEFFENBACH</i> The tongue was of a white or ash colour, blackish towards the root. This organ gave several barrels of oil, and is a monopoly of the `tonguer,' or `cutter-in.'

Red Birch of Wellington, Nelson, and in part of Otago and Southland. It is not so easy to see why any difficulty should have occurred in the identification of this fine timber-tree apart from the misleading tendency of the common names generally applied. The thin yet firm texture of the leaf, the prominent veins, the sharply-toothed margins, are characters that can only be confused with those afforded by a careless observer. Yet merely owing to the use of common names based upon colour, and applied or rather misapplied to the leaves, bark, or wood at the fancy of the bushman, no species has been more misunderstood. <i>Ibid.</i> 302 All the men engaged at the sawmills [of West Oxford] had heard of `tooth-leaved beech,' but only one or two of them had seen it growing, and no one had seen it converted. TOOTH-LEAVED B. <i>F. fusca</i>, Hook f. All these, however, are commonly called<i> Birches. </i> (TrNZI,17/300) [NOTES: (Kirk, NZ Beeches),]

>  <b>1875</b> <i>KIRK</i> With the view of obviating the confusion caused by the misuse of the common names hitherto applied to the New Zealand beeches, I would suggest the adoption of new names based on the obvious characteristics of their foliage:- For <i>Fagus fusca</i>, tooth-leaved beech; for <i>Fagus solandri</i>, entire-leaved beech; and for <i>Fagus menziesii</i>, round-leaved beech. (Durability NZ Timbers,17)

>  <b>1876</b> The utmost confusion prevails among the common names of the birches. There are scarcely two districts, a few miles apart, in which the same name is applied to the same tree, and a similar result may be obtained by consulting two bushmen in the same bush. With a view to obviating this difficulty Mr Kirk suggests `the adoption of new names based of the obvious characteristics of foliage [e.g.] for Fagus fusca `tooth-leaved beech'; for Fagus solandri `entire-leaved beech' etc. [This is unsuitable as foliage varies] I would suggest the retention of the common Otago names Fagus fusca - Red birch ; F. solandri - Black-heart birch ; F Menziesii - Silver birch.

>  <b>1979</b> <i>WILSON</i> Ever since the beginning, to `take' meant journeying to the islands and living there for the season and using hands or any device to catch the birds. ... to `take' also includes an `attempt to take'. During the torching season the birds run down the paths to the sea at night. Paths are used as boundaries by the [56] supervisors and in some cases the dividing line is the middle of the path. If one pursues a bird and grabs it over the other edge of the path one can be prosecuted, even although the bird came from the pursuer's manu. <i>Ibid.</i> 68 The `torching' season became known as such because the birders used flaming torches thick enough to be held aloft comfortably grasped in the hand. They were about three feet long and well soaked in muttonbird fat, before being set alight and were made from dry tree branches. Piles of these `torches' were prepared and set aside awaiting [69] the start of the `torching' and each family had their torch bearers. In most cases this duty was carried out by the children. Gradually this primitive method of `lighting the way' gave place to the European kerosene lantern and when supplies of kerosene were exhausted a lighted candle was sometimes used inside the glass globe of the lantern.

All these red firs make good spars for ships, and are frequently used by vessels visiting the settlements. The Towa spars are considered the best for this purpose. The fore-yard of the <i>Tory</i>, a 400 ton ship, was made from a green <i>towa</i> spar obtained in Queen Charlotte's Sound, which stood many severe tests without sustaining any injury. ... The only fault of this wood is its weight, but in that respect it is less objectionable than the teak which is used for the masts of all Indian-built vessels. [43] ...

>  <b>1899</b> <i>BELL</i> Townships are formed here and there as settlement proceeds; - at first a store and post office, a cottage or a blacksmith's shop perhaps; then a hotel, another store, and again another hotel. <i>Ibid.</i> 20 Sanguine in their anticipations, and bountifully provident for the wants of posterity, the promoters of these bush townships - whether it were the Government, private companies or individuals, or a supplementing of the former by the latter - made the boundaries of them wide enough for all possible future requirements, and gave ample scope for prospective development. This was very commendable and necessary in some instances, but where a township, as sometimes happened, did not `go off' at the sale, or if it did go off, was never subsequently embellished with a building of any kind, the effect had something of the ludicrous about it - for while settlement went on around the `township,' and the land was cleared and occupied, the `town' itself remained a solid block of standing bush, and the absentee owners of its acre or quarter-acre sections were only reminded of their possessions by the persistent recurrence of the notices to pay rates (In the Shadow of the Bush,3)

 <i>n.</i> in NZ since 1839 (as elswhere), a rough path or way usually, originally, trodden clear; a rough unsurfaced road [also bush track TRACK is the general use in NZ among outdoors people (trampers, etc); also for regular paths trodden by animals, e.g. <i>sheep tracks, goat tracks; trail</i> is occasionally used, ?esp. of deer cf also MAORI TRACK [AND seems to suggest a much wider spec. use in Aust.]] (See [also bush track](../A#also-bush-track))

>  <b>Sep 1958</b> In the bush or in the open do you tramp on a <i>track</i>, a <i>trail</i>, or a <i>path</i>? Not on a path one may be sure, seldom if ever on a trail, almost always on a track, like a proper New Zealander... <i>Track</i> is undoubtedly the established word in New Zealand. It is the only one occurring on maps or applied to named routes, such as <i>Hongi's track</i>, the <i>Milford track</i>, the <i>Pahiatua Bush Track Road</i>. ..[25] It is interesting to compare the use of <i>track</i> and<i> trail</i> in <i>The Tramper</i>. Through the first volumes <i>track</i> is always used when referring to an actual track, and <i>trail</i> occurs rarely and then only in the expression <i>blazed trail</i> or more or less figuratively - `to fare forth on the trail'. In 1935 there is the first definite use of <i>trail</i> as a synonym for <i>track</i> in a reference to the `Handbook of Arthur's Pass National Park'. It is significant that it occurs in reference to Arthur's Pass for trail seems to have come into use in Canterbury in this sense before it reached Wellington. It occurs once or twice in the first volume of the <i>Canterbury Mountaineer</i>, and there is the <i>B.B. Trail </i>in the Arthur's Pass Hand book of 1935. From 1939 till 1940 in <i>The Tramper, trail </i>is used moderately frequently for an actual track, e.g. `an old Maori trail', `a miner's trail', but only by the one writer, a Wellington member of the Canterbury Mountaineering Club. <i>Trail</i> shows no sign of ousting <i>track. </i> (Tararua,24) [NOTES: Ruth Mason `Track and Trail']

 <i>n.</i> (See [(contrast trail)](../(#(contrast-trail)))

>  <b>Sep 1958</b> In recent years there seems to have been a tendency to use both <i>track</i> and<i> trail</i> and to differentiate between them. A trail seems to be something narrow and perhaps rather hard to follow - a way marked only by blazes or worn by animals, usually deer. A track seems to be something broader, cut or formed by man. ... A well-known older Club member made this distinction when, on hearing him speak of a deer trail, I asked him what he thought to be the difference between <i>track</i> and <i>trail</i>. I remarked that I thought it a very recent distinction, one not occurring in the Club until about 1957. He disagreed, believing it to be one he had always known. Yet, on looking through <i>The Tramper, </i> I could not find <i>deer trail</i> used until 1944, but <i>deer track</i> occurs from the first number in 1928 onwards, and he himself had used it in 1940. It remains to be seen whether this distinction will become established. In the meantime<i> deer track </i>still seems to be used far more than <i>deer trail.</i> (Tararua,25) [NOTES: 1958 Sep Ruth Mason `Track and Trail' in Tararua 25]

>  <b>Sep 1958</b> In the bush or in the open do you tramp on a <i>track, trail</i>, or a <i>path</i>? Not on a path one may be sure, seldom if ever on a trail, almost always on a track, like a proper New Zealander. ... I well remember the shock of astonishment when in 1937 I first saw <i>trail </i>used in New Zealand. The word was on a rough signpost pointing out the beginning of White's Track at Piha. I am afraid I thought somewhat scornfully, `Hm, some townie who has never been out of the city or set foot off a pavement has got all his ideas of New Zealand outdoor life from reading books about North America.'...[25] It is interesting to compare the use of <i>track</i> and <i>trail</i> in <i>The Tramper</i>. Through the first volumes <i>track</i> is always used when referring to an actual track, and <i>trail </i>occurs rarely and then only in the expression <i>blazed trail</i> or more or less figuratively - `to fare forth on the trail'. In 1935 there is the first definite use of<i> trail</i> as a synonym for <i>track</i> in a reference to the `Handbook of Arthur's Pass National Park'. It is significant that it occurs in reference to Arhtur's Pass for trail seems to have come into use in Canterbury in this sense before it reached Wellington. It occurs once or twice in the first volume of the <i>Canterbury Mountaineer</i>, and there is the <i>B.B. Trail</i> in the Arthur's Pass Hand book of 1935. From 1939 till 1940 in <i>The Tramper, trail</i> is used moderately frequently for an actual track, e.g. `an old Maori trail', `a miner's trail', but only by the one writer, a Wellington member of the Canterbury Mountaineering Club. <i>Trail</i> shows no sign of ousting <i>track. </i> (Tararua,24) [NOTES: 1958 Sep Ruth Mason `Track and Trail' in Tararua 24]

>  <b>Sep 1958</b> In recent years there seems to have been a tendency to use both <i>track</i> and <i>trail</i> and to differentiate between them. A trail seems to be something narrow and perhaps rather hard to follow - a way marked only by blazes or worn by animals, usually deer. A track seems to be something broader, cut or formed by man. ... A well-known older Club member made this distinction when, on hearing him speak of a deer trail, I asked him what he thought to be the difference between<i> track </i>and <i>trail.</i> I remarked that I thought it a very recent distinction, one not occurring in the Club until about 1957. He disagreed, believing it to be one he had always known. Yet, on looking through <i>The Tramper</i>, I could not find <i>deer trail</i> used until 1944, but <i>deer track</i> occurs from the first number in 1928 onwards, and he himself had used it in 1940. It remains to be seen whether this distinction will become established. In the meantime <i>deer track</i> still seems to be used far more than <i>deer trail.</i> (Tararua,25) [NOTES: 1958 Sep Ruth Mason `Track and Trail' (deer shooters')]

As a New Zealander born and bred in this country I was disturbed at the unceremonious use of a word which seems to make me some sort of foreigner in my own land. ... On phoning the commission's office I was informed that despite considerable unease over the use of Tauiwi in the treaty booklet staff were told that it had to be used.

>  <b>Jan 1992</b> I find that the drowned trees had probably come from what the Fiordlanders call a tree avalanche. Because Fiordland was so thoroughly gouged by glaciers, there is virtually no topsoil on the steeper valley sides. Even the fully-grown forest has only the precarious hold of a woven skin of roots that stretch over rock. This net has a weak grip and if one section tears free it can peel the forest from the cliff-faces in great strips. The fall of just one tree can trigger a tree avalanche. (NZ Geographic,92)

This system might also apply to old workings of mines in actual work, but in most of these cases the tributors followed a thin but valuable lead, which might not be much thicker than a finger, but so rich as to be worth tunnelling or working as a tribute, in which the golden lead was pursued on an upward slope. It used to be rather shrewdly suspected that tributors were not `working on the blind' but had as former employees of the company marked a lead and covered the same by a piece of mine timber or rubble till a later date give them the chance to profit by their knowledge. Many of the tributors did exceedingly well; they had nothing except their labour to lose, and the company got some profit on a good lead, and so `where's the harm?' (Faring South,168)

>  <b>Nov 9, 1972</b> And yet in June, 1928, right in the middle of the rising tide of production, the Paparoa Coal Company was forced, for financial reasons, to lay off 85 men and close the mine. Their offer to allow the mine to be worked under tribute (which it was for several years) was bitterly opposed by the unions which claimed that the co-operative system meant the speeding of production at the expense of conditions, and that the people working in co-operative systems were little concerned about the conditions that had been built up through industrial organisation and effort over a long time.

>  <b>1938</b> <i>BURDON</i> The sheep they shore were not so well woolled on the belly and carried less wool on the points than they do now, so that fewer short blows were required to take off the trimmings; but the shears they used were one inch and a half shorter in the blade and, being joined by a single instead of a double bow, required a wrist of iron to drive them continuously throughout a summer's day. A piece of raw hide known as a knocker is now used to prevent the shears clashing when closed, but before this was introduced the clack and snap of steel meeting steel was a noise inseparable from any busy shearing shed. (High Country,84)

Standing by, the Moree native engaged in taking off the trimmings around the udder, then deliberately swept the glistening steel of his razor shears across the teats of the stud ewe, and deliberately shore them off level with the belly line.

From these the Maoris make a wine resembling light claret, taking care to strain out and not to crush the seeds, which are poisonous, with an action similar to that of strychnine.

In English names derived from the Maori, a vowel after a mute letter is not sounded. It is called in the North Island <i>Tupakihi.</i> In Maori, the verb <i>tutu</i> means to be hit, wounded, or vehemently wild, and the name of the plant thus seems to be connected with the effects produced by its poison. To `eat your toot': used as a slang phrase; to become acclimatised, to settle down into colonial ways. (Austral English,485)

A `chain-rack' is now used - a giant Hayes wire-strainer. It is sometimes, but improperly, called a `twitch'. `Twitch' is probably an amalgamation of `twist' and `hitch'.

## type
 
 <i>n.</i> [ca1945 Wellington Training College Are you types ready yet?]



 
 <i>n.</i> [cf. odd-bod]

>  <b>Jun 14, 1951</b> [Mount Ruapehu] Are you a `type' or an `odd-bod'? It was several days before I fathomed this out. The cry would go up, `Ruapehu types arriving, get cracking'. The best club cups would be sorted out, an official or prominent member would greet the new-comers, show them proudly over the house and dispense tea and hospitality with a cordial air. Then I'd hear, `Odd-bods coming up the track'. A member would supervise his arrival, see that no one entered the club room with nailed boots on, and offer a cup of tea, but there was not that ostentatious display of club china, `eats' and cordiality. I found that a `type' is a member of a recognised club and therefore someone to be treated with respect. An `odd-bod' is also a tramper or mountaineer, but of no specified breed, though entitiled to shelter. The same law holds for bush and mountain; hospitality must be dispensed for folk of the right ilk, so that the billy is always on the boil. But tourists! Well, I'd just hate to be a tourist! They were treated with loftiest contempt. I suppose I come under the heading `odd-bod', vouched for by a `type' ... (NZ Woman's Weekly,24)
