Tim and Paddy were walking along the beach when they came across two Maoris arguing, as it semed to them, ferociously. One was crying out `Tie Tim!' and the other, `Tie Paddy!'. Paddy took to his heels shouting: `You can bloody well tie Tim if you like, but I'm damned if you'll tie Paddy!' Enjoyment of the joke depends not only on knowing the meaning of the Maori forms, but also on a non-Maori perception of Maori /r/ as [d], and failure to hear a devocalised /u/ final. In 1986 it is usually necessary to `prepare' the joke with tedious explanation.
