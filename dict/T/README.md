It was probable the taewa arrived by ship in the mid to late 18th century and had become established by the time of the major settlement about 1840...

## taha Pakeha

 <i>n.</i> with TAI PARI perhaps indicative of the change in time and place of Pakeha vernacular knowledge of Maori Williams 361 <i>Tai (i) ... Sea.: timu `ebb(ing)'</i> (he tai timu<i> `low water'); pari</i> `flowing (of the tide)'. Both were intelligible to many English speakers up to at least the 1930s, and possibly the 1950s in the North Island, as witness the following joke first heard by me as a child in Havelock (South Island) possibly from an original King Country version; and first mentioned as early as 1845 by Walter Brodie in <i>The State of New Zealand </i>where it is attributed to Mr [?initial] Williams. Tim and Paddy were walking along the beach when they came across two Maoris arguing, as it semed to them, ferociously. One was crying out `Tie Tim!' and the other, `Tie Paddy!'. Paddy took to his heels shouting: `You can bloody well tie Tim if you like, but I'm damned if you'll tie Paddy!' Enjoyment of the joke depends not only on knowing the meaning of the Maori forms, but also on a non-Maori perception of Maori /r/ as [d], and failure to hear a devocalised /u/ final. In 1986 it is usually necessary to `prepare' the joke with tedious explanation.

>  <b>MORRIS</b> a New Zealand word for devil, often applied by settlers to a vicious horse or as a name for a dog. There is a dangerous river, the Taipo, on the west coast. There is considerable dispute as to whether the word is true Maori or not. The Rev. T. G. Hammond of Patea says - -->`No such Maori word as taipo, meaning devil, exists. It would mean evening-tide - tai-po. Probably the early sailors introduced attached meaning of devil from the Maori saying, `Are you not afraid to travel at night?' referring to the danger of tidal rivers.' -->On the hand, Mr. Tregear says, in his `Maori Comparative Dictionary,' s.v. - -->`Taepo, a goblin, a spectre. C.f. <i>tae</i>, to arrive; <i>po</i>, night.' The Rev. W. Colenso says, in his pamphlet on `Nomenclature' (1883), p. 5 - -->`Taepo means to visit or come by night, - a night visitant, - a spectral thing seen in dreams, - a fancied and feared thing, or hobgoblin, of the night or darkness; and this the settlers have construed to mean the Devil! - and of course their own orthodox one.' <i>(1898,Austral English,454</i>)

Yours the morning tide, mine the evening tide, meaning You pass with the morning tide, as I will pass by the evening tide). The saying was often used in war, when a man saw a young relative or friend slain; and the words were often prophetic of his own fate. The meaning is quite destroyed if the last two words are run together - taipo instead of tai po: that results in the word under discussion, making the meaning: You pass on the morning tide, while I go to the devil! - naturally a modern interpretation. A Pakeha using the expression once confused that last words and made them taepa; when it meant: You pass on the morning tide, while I get over the fence.

## tamarikitanga
 
 <i>n.</i> (See [tamariki](../T#tamariki))



## tamarillo
 
 <i>n.</i> (formerly in New Zealand called tree tomato) a bright red, subtropical fruit grown on a small tree. [pl. -os]

>  The tamarillo, it seems, is still a fruit New Zealand has largely to itself, for though it is grown in private gardens around the world in warm frost-free places like California, South Africa, Asia and Africa, only here is it cultivated systematically on a commercial scale... In the 1880s, Mr D Morris, director of the Botanbical Gardens in Jamaica, sent seeds to the hill districts of India and Sri Lanka, and it was from northern India that the first seeds were sent to New Zealand, to Hay and Sons, nurserymen of Parnell in Auckland. The Hay's 1891-1892 catalogue states that the nursery then had "plants of strong and healthy appearance" for sale... The name "tamarillo" officially came into being on January 31, 1967, after New Zealand exporters decided a more romantic, exotic name was needed than "tree tomato". The strategy worked, and today tamarillo seems to have become the accepted name internationally. <i>(Jun 12, 2004,Dominion Post,E8</i>)

>  He cites the economic potential of the pepino on a par with the tamarillo. <i>(Jun 1982,Orchardist NZ,143</i>)

>  On February 1, 1967, the name tamarillo officially replaced tree tomato. <i>(Feb 1967,Orchardist NZ,23</i>)

>  The tamarillo or tree tomato, <i>Cyphomandra betacea</i> Sendt.. is a native of Brazil and Peru. <i>(Jun 1970,Orchardist NZ,149</i>)

>  <b>YEREX</b> Tamarillos have been around for a long time and do quite well on the local market. <i>(1988,Best of Both Worlds,109</i>)

>  We're [sc. the Rural Bank] also financing orchids, carnations and roses for export.. even sub-tropical fruits such as tamarillos, persimmons, avocados and kiwifruit. <i>(Apr 6, 1985,Listener (New Zealand Listener),72</i>)

>  <b>BURTON</b> A native of the Andean region of Peru and of southern Brazil, the tamarillo is the only one of the 30 species of its genus, Cyphomandra, to be widely known...It was from northern India that the first seeds were sent to New Zealand, in 1891, to D. Hay & Sons, nurserymen of Parnell, Auckland. <i>(1985,Delectable Fruits Cookery,145</i>)

>  Gently peel the tamarillos then carefully slide them into the simmering syrup. <i>(Sep 1999,Cuisine,No. 76 : 86</i>)

>  The Sex Kitten uses perfectly ripe tamarillos, blended with homemade vanilla sugar syrup and extra vanilla scraped from the pod, strained and frozen into ice cubes. <i>(Sep 11, 2003,Dominion Post,D1</i>)

>  Although it sounds Spanish, the name 'tamarillo' is another New Zealand invention. The former name 'tree tomato', was considered inappropriate for use overseas where people buying the fruits for the first time might expect them to taste like tomatoes. In 1967, orchardist Bill Thomson took the Maori word 'tama' added 'tillo' (taken from tomatillo, a complete unrelated Mexican fruit) and then (just to make the sound more mellifluous) he replaced 't' with an 'r'. Thus, 'tamarillo' was born. <i>(Apr 1991,NZ Geographic,58</i>)

>  So if you are a true New Zealander who enjoys cutting a tamarillo in half and scooping out the juicy flesh straight into your mouth, there is still plenty of time for this refreshing tonic. <i>(Aug 20, 2005,Listener (New Zealand Listener),58</i>)

>  The currency of <i>tree tomato</i> (p. 263) might also owe something to New Zealand, where the tree is well known and has always been called <i>tree tomato </i>(until in 1967 the growers decided to change the name to <i>tamarillo</i>, thought to be a better name for publicity). <i>(1968,Anglia,86/359</i>) [NOTES: G.W.Turner review Pitcairnese Language]

>  ... other subtropical fruits such as passionfruit, Chinese gooseberries, feijoas, and tamarillos (formerly called `tree tomatoes'). <i>(1974,NZ Agriculture,126</i>)

>  Supplies of tropical fruits were curtailed because of the Japanese threats to the sea lanes, and tamarillo (or tree tomato as they were then known) growing began in earnest. [WWII] <i>Ibid.</i> 141 An uncultivated native of the Andes region of Peru, the tamarillo is also found wild in India, Sri Lanka and parts of South East Asia. It was from the hilly regions of northern India that New Zealand's first seeds came, introduced by the Auckland nursery of D. Hay and Sons in 1891. At first only the yellow and purple varieties were grown and it was not until the end of World War I that the now almost universal red variety was bred at Mangere, Auckland. <i>(1982,Two Hundred Years of NZ Food & Cookery,31</i>)

>  Two well-known New Zealand exports, neither of them native, are tree-tomatoes and Chinese gooseberries, but neither is called that by the exporters. The tomatoes are a South American fruit, a rich source of vitamin C and long popular in New Zealand. About twenty years ago, the name <i>tamarillo</i> was deliberately contrived, much as a brand name is. On the basis of <i>tomato</i>, a diminutive<i> -ill-</i> was added; then <i>tomatillo</i> was altered, in honor of a legendary Maori tribal hero, Tama-te-kapua, to <i>tamatillo</i>; and then a change to <i>tamarillo</i> was considered more euphonious. And so a new word was born. <i>(1985,Verbatim,2/11</i>) [NOTES: (G.W.Turner)]

>  <b>FIRTH</b> Among the Maori, considerations of aesthetic interest helped quite materially ... to decide the relative worth of objects made of the <i>pounamu</i>, the nephrite so much prized for pendants, <i>mere</i>, and adzes. Most prized was the <i>kahurangi</i> stone, bright green, translucent, hard and clear; the <i>inanga</i> variety perhaps comes next, with its white milky-veined appearance, [389] followed by the <i>kawakawa</i>, dark olive-green, dull and opaque. ... <i>Tangiwai</i> (`tear drop'), <i>bowenite</i>, a softer stone of a clear pale green, with the appearance of drops of water in the texture, was less esteemed, though more beautiful in the European eyes, whilst <i>kahotea</i>, green, spotted or streaked with black, was an inferior type, and was used for small chisels, and for objects of subordinate interest. <i>(1929,Primitive Economics of NZ Maori,388</i>)

An example is a whakapapa (genealogy) staff. <i>(1984,Te Maori,21</i>)

>  <b>MANING</b> There was a kind of variation on the <i>tapu</i>, called <i>tapa</i>, of this nature. For instance, if a chief said, `That axe is my head', the axe became his to all intents and purposes, except, indeed, the owner of the axe was able to break his `head', in which case, I have reason to believe, the <i>tapa</i> would fall to the ground. It was, however, in a certain degree necessary to have some legal reason, or excuse, for making the <i>tapa</i>; but to give some idea of what constituted the circumstances under which a man could fairly <i>tapa</i> anything, I must needs quote a case in point. <i>(1863,Old New Zealand,(xii) 174</i>)

>  <b>YATE</b> A man who has touched a very young child, or has approached a corpse, or has rendered the last sad offices of friendship for a friend, is strictly tapued for several days; and is not allowed to touch food with his hands, nor in any way to feed himself, but by picking up his sustenance from the ground with his lips and teeth. <i>(1835,New Zealand (various authors/titles),85</i>)

>  <b>POLACK</b> ... such would have been Caddell's fate, had he not ran up to a chief ... who happened accidentally to be tapued at the time, and, catching hold of his garment, was saved in consequence; ... <i>Ibid.</i>1/67 She politely welcomed us, as we marched through her plantation of Indian corn and kumeras [a-acute], which were nearly ripe and in fine condition : unfortunately for us, the place was strictly tapued, or prohibited from being touched by any person, until the following harvest; ..<i>Ibid.</i>1/141 The whole of the prepared flax was tapued [a-acute], and of course safe from depredation. <i>(1838,New Zealand  (Polack),1/52</i>)

>  <b>MAJORIBANKS</b> The `tapu' or tabboo is a ceremony common to New Zealand, along with all the other South Sea Islands. The power of `tapuing' seems to be vested in the principal chief alone, and may be considered the most important bulwark of his authority. This ceremony [90] renders every object, either animate or inanimate, sacred, or not to be approached, so that no person can enter tapued ground, nor touch a tapued person. Every girl promised in marriage is tapued, and married women also, until chastised by their husbands, when the `tapu' ceases, and they are then free to any one who can catch them, a remarkably good plan for securing the affections of the husband, and relieving the sex from some of those periodical chastisements in which some of the husbands in this country are so apt to indulge. Favourite pigs, canoes, and muskets are sometimes tabooed; burial ground is always tabbooed, and so is also a chief's head. <i>(1844,Travels in NZ,89</i>)

## tapuing
 
 <i>n.</i> [aka tabooing]

>  Tiroa [205] returned the knife to me, after he had taken the taboo off, by rubbing it over with the gills of a fish. This strange custom of tabooing I do not understand, further than that it is a law strictly observed, & any wilful breach of it is considered a serious offense, & in severe instances punishable by death. <i>(1827,Boultbee Journal,204</i>) [NOTES: 1827 Boultbee Journal in 1979 Begg 204-205]

>  <b>MAJORIBANKS</b> The `tapu' or tabboo is a ceremony common to New Zealand, along with all the other South Sea Islands. The power of `tapuing' seems to be vested in the principal chief alone, and may be considered the most important bulwark of his authority. This ceremony [90] renders every object, either animate or inanimate, sacred, or not to be approached, so that no person can enter tapued ground, nor touch a tapued person. Every girl promised in marriage is tapued, and married women also, until chastised by their husbands, when the `tapu' ceases, and they are then free to any one who can catch them, a remarkably good plan for securing the affections of the husband, and relieving the sex from some of those periodical chastisements in which some of the husbands in this country are so apt to indulge. Favourite pigs, canoes, and muskets are sometimes tabooed; burial ground is always tabbooed, and so is also a chief's head. <i>(1844,Travels in NZ,89</i>)

>  <b>Campbell</b> When any article was fancied, the intending purchaser took a thrumb from the fringe of his or her mat, and fastened it on to the chosen article. If the selector happened to be wearing a blanket or shirt or mat without a fringe, or wearing nothing at all, as was sometimes the case, from which any tapu-ing mark could be detached, then a neighbouring flax bush, or piece of flax from a potato kit, supplied the wherewithal to affix the tapu. <i>(1881,Poenamo,4/6/293</i>)

>  The committtee of runanga have (I hear) agreed to allow the sale of wheat, provided it never rules at a lower rate here than 5s. cash; but as they say we have been making a profitable spec. by sending timber to your market, they have stopped that branch of trade by tapuing the sale of all timber, firewood, &c., either for sale or home consumption. <i>(Jan 29, 1859,Otago Witness,6</i>) [NOTES: Reprinted from the <i>Hawke's Bay Herald</i>]

>  There was a meeting convened for the purpose of taking into consideration the propriety of tapuing an aukati at Aotea, for the object of preventing any white traders visiting Kawhia; and it was agreed by runanga that no persons should be allowed to pass he boundary line without signing their names in a kind of pass-book, kept for the purpose by Maaka, the King's toll-keeper. <i>(Jun 13, 1867,Daily Southern Cross,3</i>)

 <i>n.</i> [usually tenths]

>  As it was a test suit by which their right to all the other sections was to be determined, their claim to the 'tenths' has passed away. <i>(1877,NZ Parliamentary Debates,517</i>)

>  The matter is still further complicated by the stipulation attached to the various trusts, such as the Kemp Trust, and the Native tenths, from which some of the medical officers are paid. <i>(May 16, 1913,Poverty Bay Herald,8</i>)

>  Attempts to place a contemporary value on the nearly four million acres Ngai Tahu should have owned had the Crown set aside the promised "tenth" of all land sold is extraordinarily difficult. <i>(Nov 1993,North & South,60</i>)

>  The Whakarewa Grant was part of what was called the `tenth', a term coined by the New Zealand Company for land it reserved for Maori people. The principle of the tenths was conveyed in the instructions from the New Zealand Company in 1839 to its principal agent, Colonel William Wakefield, before he set out for New Zealand. In `every purchase of land from the natives ... a proportion of the territory ceded will be reserved by the Company and held in trust by them for the future benefit of the chief families of the tribe ... `You will explain that after English immigration and settlement a tenth of the land will be far more valuable than the whole was before'. ... To Alexander MacKay, commissioner of Native Lands, writing in 1872, the tenths `guarded the natives that common failing of all Aboriginal races, want of foresight, and it secured them from the dangers to which colonisation exposed them'. In short, land was a better asset for the Maoris than cash. In Nelson, the `tenth' comprised a total of 15,000 acres of land, involving a mix of urban and rural land in Nelson, Motueka, and Golden Bay. Most of that land remains in Maori ownership and today is managed by an incorporation. The Whakarewa land - the most valuable area of the tenth - has however been subverted from the control of the ... <i>(Jul 1986,New Outlook,28</i>)

>  [Colonel William Wakefield] set about negotiating the purchase of some 160,000 acres and in Septmeber 1839 a deed of purpose, written in English, was signed by 16 local chiefs. It provided that one tenth of the land purchased would be reserved for the Maori owners of the Land... No proper explanation was given to Maori of the 'tenths' reserve scheme, nor were they made aware that the deed of purchase made no provision for the retention by Maori of their pa, cultivations, and burial grounds. <i>(Jun 2003,Wel-com (Wellington),13</i>)

>  They claim that they are descended from one of the chiefs who sold the land around Port Nicholson to Col. Wakefield in the early days of settlement, and that they are entitled to their share of what are known as the Wellington tenths. <i>(Sep 6, 1899,Evening Post,5</i>)

>  Fortunately for some of the Maoris of the Porirua and Hutt districts they are in receipt of small yearly sums from the proceeds of their interests in the Nelson and Wellington "tenths" and the rents of small pieces of land. <i>(Nov 2, 1906,Evening Post,6</i>)

>  Of the 110,000 acres so measured one tenth part is to be reserved for the use or benefit of the aborigines, according to the original plan of sale proposed by the New Zealand company; and the lands for the aborigines shall be selected by lot, as provided for by the same plan of sale. <i>(Dec 10, 1840,New Zealand Gazette & Wellington Spectator,1</i>)

## tenure review
 
 <i>n.</i> (Rural) an exchange of some Crown-leased land for conservation purposes, for freehold title to the remainder of a leased property.

>  It's called "tenure review", an unremarkable term for a remarkable transformation now taking place in our legendary South Island high country. In exchange for giving up the scenic and uneconomic parts of their land for a massive conservation estate, pastoral lease holders get freehold title to the rest of their property. [18] Currently, the main way of achieving it [sc. taking land for the conservation estate]is known as tenure review; a huge land swap inside the pastoral leases that make up 20 percent of the South Island and 10 percent of New Zealand. <i>(Jul 12, 2003,Listener (New Zealand Listener),16</i>)

>  When Jim Morris of Ben Avon Station entered tenure review, he did it with an open mind, prepared to move with the times and embrace the consequences. <i>(Jun 2007,Conservation Action,17</i>)

>  High-country farmers are quietly opting for tenure review because many are likely to become wealthy from what is [7] one of the best real estate deals in New Zealand in the last 50 years... I suspect that history will judge tenure review as not such a great idea for farmning or the public... What should have happened is a careful review of the pastoral lease system to maintain this unique form of land tenure, with adjustments to assist farmers to diversify and to protect uneconomic land. <i>(Jul 26, 2003,Listener (New Zealand Listener),6</i>)

>  <b>Relph</b> After six years about two-thirds of the 300 pastoral leases in the South Island have passed through or are undergoing tenure review. <i>(2007,From Tussocks to Tourists,144</i>)

The runholder allowed the owner of the ewes 2s 6d a head a year for their wool and marked 40 per cent. of lambs for the owner as well; or they shared the increase equally. When the ewe lambs became old enough they were bred from as well, so that by the end of the time arranged (anything from three to seven years) the owner had a much larger mob to sell than he had started with. The practice was so much in vogue that in 1863 C.M. Ollivier published a pamphlet computing the interest and profit of <i>s. o. t.</i> at the various lengths of time.

In 1851 a number of Australian `squatters' came over and took up runholding in Canterbury, but, generally speaking, their advent was some years later in Otago. ... They brought over a number of Australian aborigine words that were new to this side, and which were used a certain amount, usually in a joking manner as far as I know. I have heard some of them fairly frequently used by the `old hands,' sometimes oracularly and sometimes as a semi-humorous quotation. When I was a boy I heard sheep called `jumbucks,' an Australian aborigine term for them, but with the decease of ex-Australian stockmen the word has gone out of use now. Another term brought over from Australia was `maimai,' for a rough shelter from the weather. It was said to be a name for a blackfellow's camp, which I have always seen spelt `miamia,' and which is called `gunyah' or `wurley,' etc., by some tribes. We now apply the name to shooting shelters. <i>(1947,Early Runholding in Otago,10</i>)

Finally I ran it to earth in a seven-volume Century, published back in 1891, which gave it as `A short violent downpour of rain in connection with a thunder-storm (Rare),' and produced a 19th century quotation. Perhaps we didn't hear it much in Invercargill in my younger days because thunderplumps are pretty uncommon there; but a colleague who came from Winton certainly knew of it; and it was even noised abroad by the Canterbury English. ... <i>(Nov 18, 1977,Otago Daily Times</i>) [NOTES: (Griffiths Collection)]

>  insect larva Order 4 (alder-flies) is represented in New Zealand by only a single species <i>Archicauliodes dubitatus</i>, an insect of large size, whose fat, succulent larva is found under rocks in streams, and forms excellent food for trout. This larva is called the `black creper,' or sometimes the `toe-biter'. <i>(Jan 1921,NZ Journal of Science & Technology,3/273</i>) [NOTES: (Tillyard)]

>  <b>NATUSCH</b> The Dobson fly ... is a speckled orange-winged insect which flits weakly over streams at dusk. The larva (known as the black creeper or toe-biter). . . hides under stones in the creek bed by day, coming out for a night's career with its powerful jaws ready to seize and devour whatever comes its way; <i>(1967,Animals of NZ, The,151</i>)

>  She made a sudden dip and scooped up a creature she identified as the nymph of a dobsonfly. "It's known as the 'toe-biter,'" she said, "on account of its large jaws and habit of nipping bare feet." <i>(Nov 2002,NZ Geographic,No. 50/51</i>)

>  It is perfectly true that the big bags early in the season are obtained principally by the aid of the "toe-biter," which "hangs out" under stones near the water's edge; but matters adjust themselves later, for the "toe-biters" develop into a fly or something, and they are no longer found in any number. <i>(Nov 2, 1901,Nelson Evening Mail,2</i>)

## toe-ragger
 
 <i>n.</i>

>  <b>MORRIS</b> <i>Toe-ragger, n.</i> In the bush a term of abuse; though curiously in one or two parts of New South Wales the word `toey,' which is derived from it, is a term of praise, a `swell.' The word has been explained as of convict origin, that the rags were used to soothe the galling of fetters; but the explanation is not satisfactory, for the part galled by the irons would not be the toe, but the ankle. A writer in `Truth' has cleared up the word (see quotation). It is of Maori origin. Away from Maoriland "toe-rigger' had no meaning, and a false meaning and origin were given by the change of vowel. <i>(1898,Austral English,472</i>)

>  `The bushie's favorite term of opprobrium `a toe-ragger' is also probably from the Maori. Amongst whom the nastiest term of contempt was that of <i>tau rika rika</i>, or slave. The old whalers on the Maoriland coast in their anger called each other toe-riggers, and to-day the word in the form of toe-ragger has spread through-out the whole of the South Seas.' <i>(Jan 12, 1896,Truth (Sydney)</i>)

>  <b>BAKER</b> Another old whaling term - this time a pejorative - is toe-rigger, which is the original of the still-current slang expression in Australia, <i>toe-ragger.</i> Here is what the Sydney Truth, January 12, 1896 had to say on the subject: "The bushie's favourite term of opprobrium, a toe-ragger, is...probably from the Maori, amongst whom the nastiest term of contempt was that of tau rika rika, or slave. The old whalers on the Maoriland coast in their anger called each other toe-riggers and to-day the word in the form of toe-ragger has spread throughout the whole of the South Seas.'

## Tomorrow's Schools
 
 <i>phr.</i>

>  The Tomorrow's Schools policy provided an innovative and sound model of educational administration which achieved a consensus among parents and teachers.

 <i>n.</i>

>  <b>BAKER</b> The now obsolete term <i>tonguer</i> was also in use in the early 1830's, and very likely before it although I have discovered no written records of it prior to 1836. A tonguer was a native or white living in New Zealand who assisted a whaling crew to cut up whales and who also acted in the capacity of an interpreter. These men earned their name not from the act of interpreting, but from the fact that they were given the whale's carcase and tongue to dispose of as they wished. <i>(1941,NZ Slang,13</i>)

(The Ships all employ Tonguers [sic] and it is a general custom I have acceded on the same terms as others) On his arrival we opened the Subject but they [sc Maoris] were ashamed and finally settled that they would build the house. ... I must not omit here Some mention of what are called tonguers. they [sic] are here 2 and 3 white people who have a boat and some natives on a ship arriving they repair on board to solicit the Job for the ship The terms are that they occasionally furnish a crew to help tow whales they furnish a boats crew to help cut the whale in and do any talking for the captain whose ignorance of the language requires their aid in any matters with the natives. When the whale is cut in they are entitled to the carcass and the tongue which in plentiful Whaling is always left on the carcass and they contrive to get for [sic] 6 to 8 barrels of oil from each carcass but they are in general Blackguards and no dependence can be put in them - Runaways from Ships Mostly. [McNab's ed. fn] The Americans had ... to rely to a great extent upon Maori labour and to be indebted to the services of interpreters. These men were locally [?Cloudy Bay] called `tonguers'. ... In `The Piraki Log' [1911] the word `tonguer' is suggested as a corruption of the Maori `tonga'. This is quite wrong.

>  [<i>Notho]fagus fusca</i>,Hook. f. ... Tooth-leaved Beech. Black Birch of Auckland and in part of Otago and Southland. Black or Bull Birch of Lake Wakatipu. Red Birch of Wellington, Nelson, and in part of Otago and Southland. It is not so easy to see why any difficulty should have occurred in the identification of this fine timber-tree apart from the misleading tendency of the common names generally applied. The thin yet firm texture of the leaf, the prominent veins, the sharply-toothed margins, are characters that can only be confused with those afforded by a careless observer. Yet merely owing to the use of common names based upon colour, and applied or rather misapplied to the leaves, bark, or wood at the fancy of the bushman, no species has been more misunderstood. <i>Ibid.</i> 302 All the men engaged at the sawmills [of West Oxford] had heard of `tooth-leaved beech,' but only one or two of them had seen it growing, and no one had seen it converted. TOOTH-LEAVED B. <i>F. fusca</i>, Hook f. All these, however, are commonly called<i> Birches. </i> <i>(1885,TrNZI,17/300</i>) [NOTES: (Kirk, NZ Beeches),]

>  <b>KIRK</b> With the view of obviating the confusion caused by the misuse of the common names hitherto applied to the New Zealand beeches, I would suggest the adoption of new names based on the obvious characteristics of their foliage:- For <i>Fagus fusca</i>, tooth-leaved beech; for <i>Fagus solandri</i>, entire-leaved beech; and for <i>Fagus menziesii</i>, round-leaved beech. <i>(1875,Durability NZ Timbers,17</i>)

>  The utmost confusion prevails among the common names of the birches. There are scarcely two districts, a few miles apart, in which the same name is applied to the same tree, and a similar result may be obtained by consulting two bushmen in the same bush. With a view to obviating this difficulty Mr Kirk suggests `the adoption of new names based of the obvious characteristics of foliage [e.g.] for Fagus fusca `tooth-leaved beech'; for Fagus solandri `entire-leaved beech' etc. [This is unsuitable as foliage varies] I would suggest the retention of the common Otago names Fagus fusca - Red birch ; F. solandri - Black-heart birch ; F Menziesii - Silver birch. <i>(1876,TrNZI,64/</i>) [NOTES: (Blair),]

>  <b>WILSON</b> Ever since the beginning, to `take' meant journeying to the islands and living there for the season and using hands or any device to catch the birds. ... to `take' also includes an `attempt to take'. During the torching season the birds run down the paths to the sea at night. Paths are used as boundaries by the [56] supervisors and in some cases the dividing line is the middle of the path. If one pursues a bird and grabs it over the other edge of the path one can be prosecuted, even although the bird came from the pursuer's manu. <i>Ibid.</i> 68 The `torching' season became known as such because the birders used flaming torches thick enough to be held aloft comfortably grasped in the hand. They were about three feet long and well soaked in muttonbird fat, before being set alight and were made from dry tree branches. Piles of these `torches' were prepared and set aside awaiting [69] the start of the `torching' and each family had their torch bearers. In most cases this duty was carried out by the children. Gradually this primitive method of `lighting the way' gave place to the European kerosene lantern and when supplies of kerosene were exhausted a lighted candle was sometimes used inside the glass globe of the lantern. <i>(1979,Titi Heritage,55</i>)

This was very commendable and necessary in some instances, but where a township, as sometimes happened, did not `go off' at the sale, or if it did go off, was never subsequently embellished with a building of any kind, the effect had something of the ludicrous about it - for while settlement went on around the `township,' and the land was cleared and occupied, the `town' itself remained a solid block of standing bush, and the absentee owners of its acre or quarter-acre sections were only reminded of their possessions by the persistent recurrence of the notices to pay rates <i>(1899,In the Shadow of the Bush,3</i>)

 <i>n.</i> in NZ since 1839 (as elswhere), a rough path or way usually, originally, trodden clear; a rough unsurfaced road [also bush track TRACK is the general use in NZ among outdoors people (trampers, etc); also for regular paths trodden by animals, e.g. <i>sheep tracks, goat tracks; trail</i> is occasionally used, ?esp. of deer cf also MAORI TRACK [AND seems to suggest a much wider spec. use in Aust.]] (See [also bush track](../A#also-bush-track))

>  In the bush or in the open do you tramp on a <i>track</i>, a <i>trail</i>, or a <i>path</i>? Not on a path one may be sure, seldom if ever on a trail, almost always on a track, like a proper New Zealander... <i>Track</i> is undoubtedly the established word in New Zealand. It is the only one occurring on maps or applied to named routes, such as <i>Hongi's track</i>, the <i>Milford track</i>, the <i>Pahiatua Bush Track Road</i>. ..[25] It is interesting to compare the use of <i>track</i> and<i> trail</i> in <i>The Tramper</i>. Through the first volumes <i>track</i> is always used when referring to an actual track, and <i>trail</i> occurs rarely and then only in the expression <i>blazed trail</i> or more or less figuratively - `to fare forth on the trail'. In 1935 there is the first definite use of <i>trail</i> as a synonym for <i>track</i> in a reference to the `Handbook of Arthur's Pass National Park'. It is significant that it occurs in reference to Arthur's Pass for trail seems to have come into use in Canterbury in this sense before it reached Wellington. It occurs once or twice in the first volume of the <i>Canterbury Mountaineer</i>, and there is the <i>B.B. Trail </i>in the Arthur's Pass Hand book of 1935. From 1939 till 1940 in <i>The Tramper, trail </i>is used moderately frequently for an actual track, e.g. `an old Maori trail', `a miner's trail', but only by the one writer, a Wellington member of the Canterbury Mountaineering Club. <i>Trail</i> shows no sign of ousting <i>track. </i> <i>(Sep 1958,Tararua,24</i>) [NOTES: Ruth Mason `Track and Trail']

 <i>n.</i> (See [(contrast trail)](../(#(contrast-trail)))

>  In recent years there seems to have been a tendency to use both <i>track</i> and<i> trail</i> and to differentiate between them. A trail seems to be something narrow and perhaps rather hard to follow - a way marked only by blazes or worn by animals, usually deer. A track seems to be something broader, cut or formed by man. ... A well-known older Club member made this distinction when, on hearing him speak of a deer trail, I asked him what he thought to be the difference between <i>track</i> and <i>trail</i>. I remarked that I thought it a very recent distinction, one not occurring in the Club until about 1957. He disagreed, believing it to be one he had always known. Yet, on looking through <i>The Tramper, </i> I could not find <i>deer trail</i> used until 1944, but <i>deer track</i> occurs from the first number in 1928 onwards, and he himself had used it in 1940. It remains to be seen whether this distinction will become established.

>  <b>HYDE</b> There was a dark trail, ... and a stream came with edgings of fine malachite ferns, ... Purple berries lay fallen, rich as damsons but not as big, and good only for the fantails ... <i>(1938,Godwits Fly, The,126,1970 ed.</i>)

>  In the bush or in the open do you tramp on a <i>track, trail</i>, or a <i>path</i>? Not on a path one may be sure, seldom if ever on a trail, almost always on a track, like a proper New Zealander. ... I well remember the shock of astonishment when in 1937 I first saw <i>trail </i>used in New Zealand. The word was on a rough signpost pointing out the beginning of White's Track at Piha. I am afraid I thought somewhat scornfully, `Hm, some townie who has never been out of the city or set foot off a pavement has got all his ideas of New Zealand outdoor life from reading books about North America.'...[25] It is interesting to compare the use of <i>track</i> and <i>trail</i> in <i>The Tramper</i>. Through the first volumes <i>track</i> is always used when referring to an actual track, and <i>trail </i>occurs rarely and then only in the expression <i>blazed trail</i> or more or less figuratively - `to fare forth on the trail'. In 1935 there is the first definite use of<i> trail</i> as a synonym for <i>track</i> in a reference to the `Handbook of Arthur's Pass National Park'. It is significant that it occurs in reference to Arhtur's Pass for trail seems to have come into use in Canterbury in this sense before it reached Wellington. It occurs once or twice in the first volume of the <i>Canterbury Mountaineer</i>, and there is the <i>B.B. Trail</i> in the Arthur's Pass Hand book of 1935. From 1939 till 1940 in <i>The Tramper, trail</i> is used moderately frequently for an actual track, e.g. `an old Maori trail', `a miner's trail', but only by the one writer, a Wellington member of the Canterbury Mountaineering Club. <i>Trail</i> shows no sign of ousting <i>track. </i> <i>(Sep 1958,Tararua,24</i>) [NOTES: 1958 Sep Ruth Mason `Track and Trail' in Tararua 24]

>  In recent years there seems to have been a tendency to use both <i>track</i> and <i>trail</i> and to differentiate between them. A trail seems to be something narrow and perhaps rather hard to follow - a way marked only by blazes or worn by animals, usually deer. A track seems to be something broader, cut or formed by man. ... A well-known older Club member made this distinction when, on hearing him speak of a deer trail, I asked him what he thought to be the difference between<i> track </i>and <i>trail.</i> I remarked that I thought it a very recent distinction, one not occurring in the Club until about 1957. He disagreed, believing it to be one he had always known. Yet, on looking through <i>The Tramper</i>, I could not find <i>deer trail</i> used until 1944, but <i>deer track</i> occurs from the first number in 1928 onwards, and he himself had used it in 1940. It remains to be seen whether this distinction will become established. In the meantime <i>deer track</i> still seems to be used far more than <i>deer trail.</i> <i>(Sep 1958,Tararua,25</i>) [NOTES: 1958 Sep Ruth Mason `Track and Trail' (deer shooters')]

>  Though by no means faultless, the measure [1846 Constitution Act] seems calculated to be a fair opening to the true history of our great Southern Colony, after the preliminary chapters of tragi-comic blundering. It sweeps away the whole system of official machinery and self-impeding sophistry established by Lord Stanley - all the `Treaty of Waitangi' nonsense, and all the past Downing-Street plans for hindering the settlement of the islands.' Henceforward, echoed the Colonial Gazette, `the humbug treaty of Waitangi' would be `very properly laid on the shelf'. <i>(Jan 2, 1847,Wellington Spectator</i>) [NOTES: 1847 Jan 2 Wellington Spectator in 1958 Miller Early Victorian NZ 149]

>  The treaty settlements, says Maanu Paul, are "a recipe for disaster." <i>(Sep 26, 1999,Sunday Star Times,C6</i>)

>  [Hdg] Treaty settlements cost Crown $500m. Settling historical Treaty of Waitangi claims had cost the Crown more than half a million dollars... It was not possible to estimate the total cost to the Crown of settlements of all historical claims. <i>(Jul 6, 2000,Dominion,2</i>)

## Treaty trout
 
 <i>n.</i> (humorous, for trout illegally taken)

>  <b>FINLAYSON</b> The sport turned out to be spearing trout. ... Seeing Henry's wonderment, Moses gave him a sly dig in the ribs. `These the treaty trout,' he grinned. `Waitangi, you know, the Maori own all the fish for ever. God bless the Queen!' <i>(1938,Brown Man's Burden,22,1973 ed.</i>)

>  <b>FINLAYSON</b> `treaty trout'. A reference to the widely-held belief in a clause of the Treaty of Waitangi, signed in 1840 between Governor Hobson and some of the Maori chiefs, which ostensibly guarantees to Maoris the right to hunt and fish for as long as they wish in the country of which they gave sovereignty to Queen Victoria, the queen Moses blesses. Recent historical research shows that the supposed clause is not present in the Maori text that was signed, though it occurs in some of the variant English versions. ... In any case Maoris have not been exempt from laws restricting fishing and hunting. <i>(1973,Brown Man's Burden,136 [note 11 to p.22]</i>)



## Treaty-mongering
 
 <i>n.</i>

>  What her government is paying for..[is] all the bans and taxes and wowserism against mostly blameless people like smokers, dog owners, sherry drinkers and amateur home-builders; the indiscriminate Treaty-mongering... <i>(Jul 2, 2005,Listener (New Zealand Listener),21</i>)

## treatyism
 
 <i>n.</i> an excessive reliance on, or application of, the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi.

>  Beyond treaty-ism, this [discrimination towards Maori in public health] is the next level of deep research. <i>(Jul 15, 2007,Sunday (Sunday Star Times Magazine),A9</i>)

>  It is seen that Justice Elias is an admitted judicial activist, a supporter of treatyism, a de fact race separatist... Despite all this, Justice Elias is recruited as Chief Justice in the apparent expectation she will help Parliament ablate, if not suppress, public opposition to treatyism... Even Albert Einstein, brilliant in one orbit, was a dunce in another, as Justice Elias seems over treatyism. <i>(Apr 16, 1999,Evening Post,6</i>)

>  In his eyes, Dr Prasad committed the unpardonable sin of challenging the all-pervasive advance of Treatyism, with its implications of preferential treatment for Maori. <i>(Nov 7, 2000,Evening Post,4</i>)

## treatyology
 
 <i>n.</i>

>  Perhaps realising this topic could be seen as disloyal, English revised and delivered a 2002 speech on the :"Treatyology" of relations instead... <i>(Oct 29, 2005,Listener (New Zealand Listener),24</i>)

>  English's Robert Chapman lecture last night, which Upton was originally asked to deliver, focussed on what he calls "treatyology" and the challenge of ethnic diversity, which he illustrated by reference to his "Samoan-Italian-Pakeha" son's school class in which there are only three obviously "European" names. ... English's "treatyology" is "public doctrine and public policy that ... asserts that the Treaty of Waitangi underpins a contemporary constitutional partnership between Maori and the Crown or its agents and that this partnership will continue to develop towards a bifurcated state". <i>(Oct 4, 2005,NZ Herald,A13</i>)

>  "Labour can fiddle all they like, but treatyology and low expectations are rife in the education sector ..." <i>(Dec 17, 2004,Dominion Post,A2</i>)



## tree avalanche
 
 <i>n.</i>

>  I find that the drowned trees had probably come from what the Fiordlanders call a tree avalanche. Because Fiordland was so thoroughly gouged by glaciers, there is virtually no topsoil on the steeper valley sides. Even the fully-grown forest has only the precarious hold of a woven skin of roots that stretch over rock. This net has a weak grip and if one section tears free it can peel the forest from the cliff-faces in great strips. The fall of just one tree can trigger a tree avalanche. <i>(Jan 1992,NZ Geographic,92</i>)



## tree block
 
<b>1</b> <i>n.</i> (Rural) an area of land used for forestry investment.

>  Some people speak and write of them as `tree ferns' ... this is of course loose and misleading. There are fern-trees on my section up to fifty feet in height, and at least one of them - the wheki variety, is a hard-bitten fellow ...

It's a brilliant story, New Zealand's only locally designed and mass-produced motor vehicle, the Trekka, was the brainchild of Noel Turner, a millionaire who supported Labour. The first Trekka rolled off his assembly line in Otahuhu ion 1966. It came in two colours... It had a four cylinder engine, and took 11 gallons in the tank... Turner's formula was a Skoda mechanical kit, bought at basement prices from Czechoslovakia, bolted to a simple boxy body. <i>(Apr 7, 2001,Listener (New Zealand Listener),65</i>)

>  Stevenson has transformed the church into an Iron Curtain-style trade fair exhibition, taking its cue from the Trekka, the only New Zealand-designed and mass-produced motor vehicle, which was based on mechanical components from then-communist Czechoslovakia... The Trekka was the ultimate product of a mnyriad of import restrictions in the 1960s, designed to foster motor vehicle assembly in New Zealand. It was loved by those who admired it's [sic] cheap no-nonsense style as a Land Rover lookalike... "The Trekka is a way of repsenting the idea of New Zealand as an industrialised state, an example of what New Zealand in those days could become"... <i>(Jun 22, 2003,Sunday (Sunday Star Times Magazine),26</i>)

## tribute

>  <b>LYON</b> As the quartz mines began to decline in output and could no longer pay a large wage sheet, it became the custom to let them on tribute, by which parties of men were given the right to mine and raise quartz from the resultant crushing, of which a proportionate share of the gold went to the company. This system might also apply to old workings of mines in actual work, but in most of these cases the tributors followed a thin but valuable lead, which might not be much thicker than a finger, but so rich as to be worth tunnelling or working as a tribute, in which the golden lead was pursued on an upward slope. It used to be rather shrewdly suspected that tributors were not `working on the blind' but had as former employees of the company marked a lead and covered the same by a piece of mine timber or rubble till a later date give them the chance to profit by their knowledge. Many of the tributors did exceedingly well; they had nothing except their labour to lose, and the company got some profit on a good lead, and so `where's the harm?' <i>(1952,Faring South,168</i>)

>  And yet in June, 1928, right in the middle of the rising tide of production, the Paparoa Coal Company was forced, for financial reasons, to lay off 85 men and close the mine. Their offer to allow the mine to be worked under tribute (which it was for several years) was bitterly opposed by the unions which claimed that the co-operative system meant the speeding of production at the expense of conditions, and that the people working in co-operative systems were little concerned about the conditions that had been built up through industrial organisation and effort over a long time. <i>(Nov 9, 1972,Press, The,5</i>)

The passage reads: "More fondly recalled is the alliterative and now deceased TT2, the classic ice-block of the fifties and sixties and a mainstay of summer holidays for New Zealand children.

 <i>n.</i> [cf. odd-bod]

>  [Mount Ruapehu] Are you a `type' or an `odd-bod'? It was several days before I fathomed this out. The cry would go up, `Ruapehu types arriving, get cracking'. The best club cups would be sorted out, an official or prominent member would greet the new-comers, show them proudly over the house and dispense tea and hospitality with a cordial air. Then I'd hear, `Odd-bods coming up the track'. A member would supervise his arrival, see that no one entered the club room with nailed boots on, and offer a cup of tea, but there was not that ostentatious display of club china, `eats' and cordiality. I found that a `type' is a member of a recognised club and therefore someone to be treated with respect. An `odd-bod' is also a tramper or mountaineer, but of no specified breed, though entitiled to shelter. The same law holds for bush and mountain; hospitality must be dispensed for folk of the right ilk, so that the billy is always on the boil. But tourists! Well, I'd just hate to be a tourist! They were treated with loftiest contempt. I suppose I come under the heading `odd-bod', vouched for by a `type' ... <i>(Jun 14, 1951,NZ Woman's Weekly,24</i>)
