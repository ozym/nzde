>  The New Zealand Women's Team, or "the Gal Blacks" as the media referred to them, were indeed very scary in Amsterdam. (Jun 1999 -- ,Metro,89)

>  What may have been the shortest-lived New Zealand usage on record hit the headlines in May last year at the time of the women's rugbv union World Cup played in the Netherlands. As the Kiwi women rucked and ran their way with stunning ease to the title of world champions, they began to be described, by journalists initially, as the Gal Blacks, a name rather cleverly punning on (loosely rhyming with) that of their hitherto more illustrious male counterparts the All Blacks, whose classic black uniform they too wear.No sooner was the women's triumph complete, however, than it was made clear to all and sundry that the name bestowed on them was unacceptable both to the team itself and the New Zealand Rugby Football Union which administers both male and female rugby. NZRFU chief executive David Moffatt was reported as rejecting the name as inappropriate on the grounds that 'gal is an American slang term and certainly not what we want to call our team'. A replacement was promised, and in the meantime most journalists and others accepted the name's red-carding. It was sighted however on the cover of the July 1998 issue of New Zealand Sport Monthly ('Where now for the Gal Blacks?'), whose editorial lauding the team's success said the name would have to do until something better came along... What is striking about all these current brand names is that without exception they derive directly or indirectly from the prototypical All Black name. Even Gal Blacks, admittedly Americanised, was paying homage to its mana. (Jan 1999 -- ,NZWords,2(1) : 5)

 <i>n.</i> the name of a (sluggish) creek, specif. a tributary of the Kawarau River, Otago (also called `Annie's Creek').

>  <b>PYKE</b> There are three creeks in succession on this line of road - tributaries of the Kawarau River. The first is very small, and in a dry season merely drips from the rocks, and is called `Crying Jenny.' The second, which tumbles down from the mountains impetuously and with great noise, is `Roaring Meg.'

>  <b>BEATTIE</b> Amongst others who left [the Dunstan rush for Kawarau, c1862] were the members of a theatrical or concert party, and among them was a girl who sang a song called `Gentle Annie' and this name was sometimes jokingly applied to her. Going over the hills some of the rest were grouching, but she tramped on lugging her swag ... singing to cheer them on. The creek was called after her because of her brave spirit. That was said to be the reason of the name Gentle Annie, but I never heard how Roaring Meg got its name. There is a yarn nowadays that both were called after barmaids ... (1939 -- ,First White Boy Born in Otago,161)

>  <b>HISLOP</b> There are now several bonnie burns coming down the mountain sides to the river, the largest of which are the famous Roaring Meg and Gentle Annie; and a visitor ... may wash his colours of gold from almost anywhere while his wee wife boils the billy. <i>Ibid.,</i> 53 ... Roxburgh and Cromwell are well behind, and I slow down ... to enjoy the sight of the water gushing from the spillway of the newly-erected power station at the Roaring Meg corner of the [Kawarau] Gorge. This heavy stream, which breaks so suddenly on a stranger from its very rough surroundings, got its name (according to early-day tradition) from the fact that Meg, one of the two girls on their way to a dancing saloon at Arrow, created such a fuss at crossing this turbulent water that vibrations of her voice loosened rocks on the mountain side to add still further to the roaring of the stream and of Meg herself. There are different versions concerning the naming of this stream, and maybe some of this one is my own. ... A few miles further on the next stream to be crossed is the Gentle Annie, called after Meg's pal, who no doubt was a much quieter type of tourist than Meg herself. (1943 -- ,Pure Gold,20)

>  THE NAME Gentle Annie evokes many things - rivers, mountain roads, hills - in all parts of the country. Gentle Annie is an elusive figure in our folklore; sometimes an object of tender love songs, she is also known, in the company of Roaring Meg, as a colourful figure in the bars of goldrush Queenstown.

>  Talking about George (and one does a lot of it out here), it would be interesting to know why every New Zealander, irrespective of the wishes of his godfathers ... should be honoured by his sovereign's patronymic. The NZEF, not to be out-done, describes every Abdul and Hamid as `George', so that between the two the slogan `let George do it', once applied to a well-known New Zealand politician [sc.

Scouting had already found its way to New Zealand, but there was no talk of Guiding for girls. So Colonel Cosgrove called his Movement "The Girl Peace Scouts"... The girls wore khaki dresses, which were very long, but no one seemed to mind. They had hats which turned up at the sides, carried staves on all occasions, and they always had a bugler! Troop flags and haversacks were also part of the uniform. The girls did not believe in anything too tame, and had fearsome emblems such as curlews, moreporks, and peewits for their patrols. The knots were three pieces of ribbon tied in bows, to remind the girls of their threefold promise. The enrolment badge was very similar to the Girl Guide badge of to-day, with the letters P.S. (peace scout) on it... In October 1923 came official word that the Girl Guides' Association of New Zealand.. had been duly registered in London with Imperial headquarters.

The most humorous name is that of Publican-fish. The names Globe-fish and Balloon-fish were given because of the animal's habit of inflating itself with air to such an extent that the body was like a lamp globe or an inflated balloon. The Mouse-fish is the most popular among some fishermen and when the fish is distended it does present a striking resemblance to a mouse, with its cunning looking face. The name Rabbit-fish in America is so given because its teeth are like those of a rabbit. The most witty name, Publican-fish given to it by Australian fishermen, is said to have originated from the resemblance of an inflated Globe-fish to the rotundity of many successful publicans.

This was commonly called a `go-ashore'. Just how it got its name is not quite clear but the accepted explanation is as follows:- Early in the `white' history of New Zealand, some Maoris were anxious to know the name of the utensil. The white man addressed was not so much concerned about the enquiry as about landing, so instructed his companies to `go ashore'. Mistaking the instruction for an answer to their question the Maoris applied the name `goashore' to this particular kind of kettle. Whatever the origin of the name, the `go-ashore' was a valued part of the early settlers' equipment. (1936 -- ,Pioneering Days,35)

## God's own country
 
 <i>n.</i> A political or journalistic catchphrase popularised from about the times of Richard Seddon and now used mainly ironically or jocularly: often abbrev. to God's own, Godzone, Gordzone q.v. (See [also Ward's own country](../A#also-ward's-own-country))

>  The earliest recorded use of the phrase was as the title of a poem about New Zealand written by Thomas Bracken sometime in the 1880s. It was published in a book of his poems in 1890, and then again in 1893 in a book containing a selection of his works, entitled Lays and Lyrics: God's Own Country and Other Poems. God's Own Country as a phrase was often used and popularised by New Zealand's longest serving prime minister, Richard John Seddon. He last used it on June 10, 1906 when he sent a telegram to the Victorian premier, Thomas Bent, the day before leaving Sydney to return home to New Zealand. "Just leaving for God's own country," he wrote. He never made it, dying the next day on the ship Oswestry Grange.

## Government rag
 
 <i>n.</i>

>  Shinplasters.- The fact that private traders found it necessary themselves, to issue paper notes in denominations below five shillings suggests that at the outset ... the Fitzroy notes were not issued for values below five shillings. The private paper notes were issued for small change, redeemable mostly in `Five Shillings, in Government debentures.' Both the debentures and the private notes were issued on poor paper, and soon became known as `Government Rags' and `Shinplasters' respectively. The term `Shinplaster' for paper money appears to have come to New Zealand from America, via New South Wales. *[fn] In the latter Colony the issue of paper money of a denomination lower than twenty shillings was prohibited in 1826 to promote the circulation of sterling instead of a colonial currency, and the prohibition was welcomed by the people as `preventing the Colony being inundated with beggarly rags' and dollar and half-dollar notes `used often as a paltry contrivance to evade payment of debt,' vide `The Australian,' 19 July 1826. [fn] Various reasons have been given for the origin of this curious term for paper money issued in the forties. The most likely explanation comes from America (p. 650 The Numismatist, 1938), where it is stated that in the good old days post-boys and out-riders, wearing high boots, were required, at times, to pay toll-fees at toll-gates, and in order to facilitate progress they placed paper money or coins in bags in their boot-tops, against their shins - hence the term `shin-plaster.' (1941 -- ,Numismatic History of NZ,158)

>  <b>HARGREAVES</b> The [Governor Fitzroy's (1844)] Debentures, popularly known as `government rags', were given various nicknames such as assignats, `shinplasters', and `flash notes'. All these terms had reference to worthless paper money, some of which had been issued in the past. Assignats was the name given to large amounts of paper money issued in France during the French Revolution, but which depreciated to such as extent to be almost worthless. `Shinplasters'--sometimes written `skinplasters'--had its origin in North America, and again referred to depreciated paper money, while `flash notes' was a popular term in use for any counterfeit money or worthless forged paper money.

## Government valuation
 
 <i>n.</i> (historical) a property valuation by, originally, the Government Valuation Department

>  'What's the GV?' is the first question most buyers ask when they're in the market for a new house. Actually, as of 1998 there is no such thing. The job of valuing properties moved out of the government arena three years ago. The valuation of properties became contestable, and the former Government Valuation Department became a business called Quotable Value New Zealand (QV). However, councils right around the country are still required by law to put what is now called a Rateable Value on properties, and in Nelson city the tender for this work was won by QV. It is to be emphasized that the valuations are carried out totally independently of the council, with the property owner having the right to dispute the valuation with the valuer before they are set. (Feb 16, 2002 -- ,Nelson Live) [NOTES: Taken from Nelson City Council website: www.nelsoncitycouncil.co.nz]

 <i>n.</i> plantain

>  <b>HILGENDORF</b> PLANTAIN (<i>Plantago lanceolata</i>) is commonly called rib grass, lamb's tongue, horse plantain, and soldiers. It is common in pastures and waste places throughout. It forms a rosette of lanceolate leaves about 6 inches long, with prominent or converging veins, giving the name `rib grass' From the rosette rises the slender flower stalk a foot or more in length, with a crowded mass of tiny brown or black flowers at its tip. These heads are used by children for playing `soldiers,' and so in Scotland the weed is called `Carl Doddie'-that is `Charles and George'- a souvenir of 1745.

>  <b>GRAHAM</b> GREENBONE, BUTTERFISH, KELP SALMON, or KELPIE (MARARI) <i>Coridodax pullus</i> (Bloch and Schneider) ... The name Greenbone is given on account of the bones being a bright green colour, which is so permanent as to with-stand boiling or bleaching. ... The name kelp-fish is given on account of its habit of feeding on kelp or seaweed, and also because it likes to make its home among kelp. In such a habitat it has both food and a favourite home. Kelp-salmon is given for two reasons. The first part, kelp, is explained in the last paragraph, while the second half, salmon, is because the fish is not unlike a Salmon in shape, so much so that new chums who caught this fish have been under the impression they had caught the protected introduced Salmon, but of that later in this chapter. But why this dark coloured fish should receive the name Butterfish I am unable to say. It is certainly not as some people suggest because it needs butter with it when cooked or eaten. In Auckland the fish known to South Islanders as Spotty (<i>Pseudolabrus celidotus</i>) is called Butterfish on account of its bright golden colouring on the lower parts of the body and fins fancifully resembling the colour of butter. The name Kelpie, of course, is derived from its habit of living amidst kelp and it is easily understood how the `ie' was tacked on by fishermen. (1956 -- ,NZ Fishes: An Identification Guide,261,2nd ed.)

>  <b>PARROTT</b> It is unfortunate that the Butterfish [<i>Corridodax pullus</i>] has been given a variety of local names which have originated either from their habit of associating with kelp, their body form, or from the colour of their bones, as for example, Kelpfish, Kelp-salmon, Greenbone, and several other names not so easy to explain. Butterfish or Greenbone are possibly the more generally used names for this fish ... <i>Ibid.</i> 169 Butterfish <i>Corridodax pullus</i> Greenbone; Kelp Salmon; Kelpi; Kelpfish ...

Among the many policies that Age Concern itself advocates (including annual adjustments to the GRI to achieve a "reasonable standard of living") is independent research into the standard of living of older people solely dependent on the GRI.

Moreover this will go to the people who least need it - superannuitants with adequate other income who also get Guaranteed Retirement income. (Sep 17, 1990 -- ,Listener (New Zealand Listener),110)

>  <b>MULGAN</b> Once when the Press was supporting the parliamentary candidature of a member of an old family, a friend said to me: `The Press forgets that that lot `grid-ironed' Canterbury.' `Grid-ironing' was one of the old-time devices by which some landholders so arranged their properties as to keep out land-seeking strangers.

 <i>n.</i> [1883 citation belongs with the verb to gridiron]

>  <b>OVERTON</b> The system of gridironing in the early days was a practice largely followed by purchasers of land. Strips of land were taken up which made it impossible for an outsider to come in between, thus enabling as man to hold a larger area of country than at the time he could pay for. (1949 -- ,Fifty Years Sheep Farming,82)

>  <b>BRADSHAW</b> Facilities have been used in many cases for the purpose of what is called `gridironing' the country. (1883 -- ,New Zealand As It Is,32)

>  <b>MORRIS</b> Gridironing ... a term used in the province of Canterbury, New Zealand. A man purchased land in the shape of a gridiron, knowing that nobody would take the intermediate strips, which later he could purchase at his leisure. In other provinces free-selection (q.v.) was only allowed after survey. (1898 -- ,Austral English,176)

>  It was thought that the free-trade foolishness had died in New Zealand; that it had been buried with plural voting, the public soup kitchen, the conservative property tax, land gridironing, and other swindles and unpleasantnesses. (Apr 27, 1912 -- ,NZ Truth,357/4/4)

>  <b>MARKS</b> Mr John McKenzie (Seddon's Minister for Lands) ... flourished a colored [sic] map illustrating the `gridironing' that had taken place in Canterbury land. (1934 -- ,Memories (Mainly Merry),96)

>  <b>BURDON</b> Some of the runholders now thought of two new devices to preserve their estates. The first consisted of buying a series of 20 acre sections fronting on a road, [123] so spaced as to leave between them sections of 19 acres. Under the Waste Lands Regulations, none of less than 20 acres could be bought except by having it put up to auction. Few people would go to the trouble of having this done; and anyone who did was in all probability a man of small means, who stood little chance of outbidding the runholder. It usually happened, therefore, that all these 19-acre sections were retained without having to be purchased. This was known as `gridironing.' (1938 -- ,High Country,122)

>  <b>SOLJAK</b> New Zealanders have coined or adapted many expressions to meet local requirements, as illustrated by the following: ... gridironing: purchasing land in strips to oust other potential settlers (1946 -- ,New Zealand (various authors/titles),117)

>  gridironing: purchase of areas of land leaving small strips between. (1947 -- ,Reeds' School Dictionary: NZ Suppl.,173)

>  <b>SCOTTER</b> When investigating the change from pastoral lease to freehold in any locality, the student, brought up on Pember Reeves (see e.g. S.E.I. [State Experiments 1902] 234) searches immediately for evidences of the methods by which the runholder retained his grasp of the land. These practices called gridironing and spotting can be defended: there is no need to do so here. If spotting is practiced - the purchase of selected areas with water and shelter for the control this gave over the surrounding country - a study of the Crown grant index maps and of the dates of the original titles supplies no evidence of it. (1948 -- ,Run, Estate and Farm,13)

>  <b>CRAWFORD</b> `Gridironing' was the practice of buying twenty acre sections fronting on a road, so spaced as to leave sections of 19 acres between them, and as these had to be auctioned the small farmer stood little chance of out bidding the runholder who usually retained them without having to purchase them. `Spotting' was buying up key positions, fertile land, and leaving the barren, water courses, entrances to valleys, road lines ... (1949 -- ,Sheep and Sheepmen of Canterbury,94)

>  <b>STEVENS</b> 24 and fn (1952 -- ,John Grigg)

>  <b>SINCLAIR</b> Where land was auctioned the system known as `grid-ironing' was useful: the leaseholder would buy a series of sections each of, say, twenty acres along a frontage, leaving perhaps eighteen acres between sections. Since no one but a poor man would want so small an area, the leaseholder could count on outbidding any rival. (1959 -- ,History of New Zealand,156)

>  gridironing n. purchasing strips of land in shane of gridiron, thus rendering intervening blocks worthless so that they could be acquired cheqply later at gridironer's pleasure. (1966 -- ,NZ Contemp. Dict. (Aust.-NZ Suppl.),616)

>  gridironing n. (Obs.) purchasing strips of land in shape of a gridiron, thus rendering intervening blocks worthless so that they could be acquired cheaply later at gridironer's pleasure. (1968 -- ,NZ Contemp. Dict. Suppl. (Collins),9)

>  <b>OLIVER</b> The runholder was protected against intruders: cottages, fences and homesteads gave him a pre-emptive right over a set number of contiguous acres. Fences and cottages could be so disposed as to give the runholder rights over the best of the land - Sources of water and wood, strips surrounding isolated and thus inaccessible pockets. `Grid-ironing' and `spotting', as these selective practices were called, were certainly used by many runholders to tie up large areas, but probably not to the extent alleged by horrified land tenure radicals in later years. (1968 -- ,Story of New Zealand, The,108)

>  <b>FRANCIS</b> A [112] powerful landowner ... had for years dominated the Haast Valley and his cattle wandered and grazed rent-free over the lush valleys and river flats - rent-free because he had leased all the access. This practice, called grid-ironing, was not uncommon and was undertaken by numerous big landowners. (1983 -- ,Wildlife Ranger,111)

>  By accepting compensation [the Chinese community] would, in a single action, have joined the "grievance industry" - an activity synonymous with failure, inertia, and an unwillingness to accept a responsibility for one's own outcomes. The Maori grievance industry is unique as Maori are the indigenous people, and have a fulcrum of newly enacted laws around which to litigate, and they clearly suffer severe handicaps which they do not seem to be able to unilaterally resolve... Of concern is that we now have a large Pacific Islands minority coat-tailing the Maori grievance industry. (Feb 21, 2002 -- ,Dominion,10)

>  When the business's part-owner went to sort that out, the grievant, who was standing by the door, alledgedly hassled and grabbed him... Here, an investigation meeting took place but it was unusual in that it proceeded without the grievant or her representative being present... The lessons to be learnt from these two cases involving drinking grievants is that, except in truly exceptional circumstances, a proper investigation must be carried out before an individal is dismissed. (Oct 17, 2002 -- ,Dominion Post,C3)

>  The Employment Tribunal, and the Employment Court on appeal, upheld their claims and awarded between three and six momnths pay for reasonable notice and $11,000 to $15,000 compensation for humiliation and distress to each grievant... As regards compensation for humilation aqnjd distress, the Court of Appeal held that the awards made to the grievants failed to distinguish between the impact of not having a job and that of the manner in which the terminations of employment were implemented... "After exercising the element of job loss, we consider that [an award] of $7000 to each [grievent] would have been appropriate," the Court of Appeal said. (Mar 11, 2002 -- ,Evening Post,20)

## Griffin weed
 
 <i>n.</i> verbena, =vervain, also Griffin's weed <i>Verbena officinalis.</i>

>  <b>GUTHRIE-SMITH</b> Vervain (<i>Verbena officinalis</i>), a species few would suspect of harm, but which by overrunning grass has proved a nuisance in a small way, is an alien of note. It has invaded us from the north, a quarter from which comparatively few road-plants have come. Its proper name has been temporarily lost, it has been renamed, and, what must be almost unique in popular botanical nomenclature, that name again lost and the plant locally rechristened ; finally, it has resumed its correct designation. This alien from southern England appeared near Frazertown in the late 'seventies. It was first noticed on a station belonging to Mr Nairn; there it began to spread, and there it became known as Nairn's weed; the station then became the property of the late Mr Griffin. Now Mr Griffin, as chairman of the Wairoa County Council, touched the business and bosom of every up-country settler in the district. People knew him who did not know and had never known his predecessor; his office advertised the plant : presently, even in the [299] immediate vicinity of its origin, the earlier designation was dropped, the later one assumed. It became known up and down the east coast as `Griffin's Weed'. (1926 -- ,Tutira,298)

## group housing
 
 <i>n.</i> [Jim writes: Hist. (mainly 1950s). A cluster of terms associated with the <i>group housing scheme</i> introduced in 1953 whereby numbers of low-cost houses in a subdivision were built by a private builder for sale - <i>group house, group housing, group builder</i>. Often the State developed the subdivision and provided services, selling the developed block to a private builder. The scheme offered home ownership as an alternative to State rental houses and was very popular... These terms are not recorded in DNZE. Note - 1. Of possible linguistic interest is the official use in this context of the term <i>block</i> in the sense of an area subdivided for group (or State) housing and <i>site</i> (not <i>lot</i>) in the sense of an individual section in such a block. There is no trace in the literature I have seen of the English term <i>housing estate</i>. 2. Group houses are associated in my recollection with <i>parades of homes</i>, at which the variety of homes in a group housing block were open for inspection by prospective buyers. This term seems to extend slightly the ordinary meanings of <i>parade</i> and is possibly a distinctive NZE compound.]

Some time after its introduction, the spear came to be fitted with what was called the `joker,' or `toggle'. This was a coil of fine wire, bound round the spear [50] a few inches from the point. It allowed the spear to be thrust into the ground with the minimum of resistance, there being no `drag' on the shaft. It is said that the forerunner of the `joker' was discovered by accident. A digger, pushing his spear into the ground, found that it had penetrated a boot-eyelet, and was surprised to find that, instead of forming an obstruction, the spear penetrated the ground more easily; the coil of fine wire was devised as an improvement. An experienced digger could detect at once, by the feel, and the resistance met by the spear, whether he had struck timber, a stone or gum. (1972 -- ,Gumdiggers, The,49)
