> Jim writes: Hist. (mainly 1950s). A cluster of terms associated with the <i>group housing scheme</i> introduced in 1953 whereby numbers of low-cost houses in a subdivision were built by a private builder for sale - <i>group house, group housing, group builder</i>. Often the State developed the subdivision and provided services, selling the developed block to a private builder. The scheme offered home ownership as an alternative to State rental houses and was very popular... These terms are not recorded in DNZE. Note - 1. Of possible linguistic interest is the official use in this context of the term <i>block</i> in the sense of an area subdivided for group (or State) housing and <i>site</i> (not <i>lot</i>) in the sense of an individual section in such a block. There is no trace in the literature I have seen of the English term <i>housing estate</i>. 2. Group houses are associated in my recollection with <i>parades of homes</i>, at which the variety of homes in a group housing block were open for inspection by prospective buyers. This term seems to extend slightly the ordinary meanings of <i>parade</i> and is possibly a distinctive NZE compound.
