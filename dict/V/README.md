THE VILLAGE, a modern usage (to be distinguished from the occasional very early British usage of emigrants), orig. deprecatingly and mainly humorously of a township or settlement by those living in the countryside outside its boundaries, or by semi-permanent residents (e.g. week-enders, bachers, etc). For example, Paraparaumu `beach' residents (once mainly a weekend population) refer to the original township on the main road as `The Village' and have done so since at least 1941; similarly for Johnsonville, originally a town, now a suburb of Wellington: their rugby supporters would call (c1950s) `Come on the village!'; the Taupo township (now near-city) was in the 1960s referred to by the large seasonal lakeside holiday population at least as Taupo village. -->The usage was probably fairly popular by at least 1940, and is now common, often being transferred to, for example, the `down-town' or shopping area of a city by those living in the suburbs (e.g. `Are you coming into the village tonight to the pictures?'); or, specifically, of shopping areas, and now custom-built shopping-complexes in the suburbs (e.g. `You go up Karori Road past the first village, and just before you come to the second, turn off right ...'; or ``Marsden Village' is the name of the recently-opened shopping area in Karori.')
