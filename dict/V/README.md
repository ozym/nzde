>  <b>DIEFFENBACH</b> Hotete - a caterpillar, the so-called vegetable caterpillar <i>(1843,Travels in NZ,2/363</i>) [NOTES: Dictionary NZ Language]

>  <b>ANGAS</b> Amongst the damp moss at the root of the rata trees, in the shady forests not far from Auckland,and also in various parts of the Northern Island, are found those extraordinary productions called vegetable caterpillars - the hotete of the natives. In appearance, the caterpillar differs but little from that of the common privet sphinx-moth, after it has descended to the ground previously to its undergoing the change into the chrysalis state. But the most remarkable characteristic of the vegetable caterpillar is, that every one has a very curious plant, belonging to the fungi tribe, growing from [292] the .us;anus; this fungi varies from three to six inches in length, and bears at its extremity a blossom-like appendage, somewhat resembling a miniature bulrush, and evidently derives its nourishment from the body of the insect. This caterpillar, when recently found, is of the substance of cork; and it is discovered by the natives seeing the tips of the fungi, which grow upwards. They account for this phenomenon by asserting that the caterpillar, when feeding upon the rata-tree overhead, swallows the seeds of the fungus, which take root in the body of the insect, and germinate as soon as it retreats to the damp mould beneath, to undergo its transformation into the pupa state. Specimens of these vegetable caterpillars have been transmitted to naturalists in England, by whom they have been named Sphoeria Robertii.[check spgs ??? see under <i>(1847,Savage Life,1/291</i>)

## village
 
 <i>n.</i> a) a populated area in the country, which is smaller than a town. b) its inhabitants. c) in New Zealand a shopping centre; the centre of a rural town, or a cluster of shops outside the centre of a city. -->[AND 1. obs a small (rural) settlement 1803-1907 2. a cluster of aboriginal dwellings] often with def. art. THE VILLAGE, a modern usage (to be distinguished from the occasional very early British usage of emigrants), orig. deprecatingly and mainly humorously of a township or settlement by those living in the countryside outside its boundaries, or by semi-permanent residents (e.g. week-enders, bachers, etc). For example, Paraparaumu `beach' residents (once mainly a weekend population) refer to the original township on the main road as `The Village' and have done so since at least 1941; similarly for Johnsonville, originally a town, now a suburb of Wellington: their rugby supporters would call (c1950s) `Come on the village!'; the Taupo township (now near-city) was in the 1960s referred to by the large seasonal lakeside holiday population at least as Taupo village. -->The usage was probably fairly popular by at least 1940, and is now common, often being transferred to, for example, the `down-town' or shopping area of a city by those living in the suburbs (e.g. `Are you coming into the village tonight to the pictures?'); or, specifically, of shopping areas, and now custom-built shopping-complexes in the suburbs (e.g. `You go up Karori Road past the first village, and just before you come to the second, turn off right ...'; or ``Marsden Village' is the name of the recently-opened shopping area in Karori.')
