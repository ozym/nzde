## unveiling
 
 <i>n.</i> a Maori customary ceremony of installing and uncovering a gravestone

>  <b>METGE</b> At tangihangi and unveilings, when eldersgather from far afield and the generalmood is serious, discussions range verywidely indeed.<i> Ibid.</i> 195 At an 'unveiling', if there is a numberof stones to be unveiled in severalcemeteries (as is common in Northland),the first ceremony takes place soon afterdaybreak. <i> Ibid. </i> 200 The idea of unveiling monuments.. hasbeen developed into a ceremony which infunction and importance recalls andperhaps replaces the pre-Europeanexhumation ceremony. <i>(1967,Maoris of New Zealand, The,178</i>)

>  <b>K SMITHYMAN</b> You know about the Maori custom of `unveiling' of tombstones? If you don't, it's more or less like this: A year after the burial the grave stone is installed, and a monument being unveiled. There used to be two recognised times for this in the North, apparently bypassing the `year after' which is seemingly more the custom of recent decades, Easter and All Saints Day, both of which are distinct from the usual fixed times for clearing the burial grounds (which were usually just before Christmas or, in some places, the first Saturday in March). In very recent years around, for instance, the Hokianga, interest and care for the burial grounds has markedly increased. Along with that has come another change, in giving notice publicly. I enclose one long clipping from the Whangarei Northern Advocate of a kind I doubt is at all common, but the NZ Herald supervisor of memorial notices tells me that to her knowledge notices of the kind have been appearing for ten years or so, but (she thinks) are now more frequent. So, for a start, we have a sense of unveiling in NZ which is likely to be peculiar as `We went up North for an unveiling (of a headstone for one or more people)'. That sense has been around for some time. What seems to be new or newish is the sense of the other clipping, `So and so was unveiled on such and such a day'. I checked with Roger Oppenheim whose book on Maori Death Customs you may know, and Roger regards this as new to him (and he has Maori kin and attends Maori gatherings of the kind). Where `Mr Te Hona's unveiling was on Saturday' doesn't strike him (or me, for that matter) as anything out of the way, `Mr Te Hona was unveiled on Saturday' registers as odd, but didn't seem odd to the Herald supervisor. <i>(Jan 26, 1984,Letter</i>)

>  <b>TUA-O-RANGI</b> [preface] Some explanation of the title, which, to persons living outside Maoriland, may appear as incomprehensible as it is odd, is perhaps called for ... Most born New Zealanders, whether fair or dark, have some conception of the meaning of the word UTU, albeit, to pakeha ears it toofrequently conveys nothing more than a hazy idea of money compensation. ... Practically, utu meant payment. The ancient Maori did nothing for nothing ... No man could accept service or gifts without requital and retain the esteem of his fellows; still less could he allow injuries to pass unavenged. Utu (value) he expected for the presents he made; utu (payment) he required for goods or produce; utu (satisfaction) he exacted from hereditary foes and all whom he conceived [?had] injured him. A vendor [?in] the early days of settlement, would request UTU for his produce; a settler desiring to purchase would enquire in his pidgin Maori, `How muchee te utu?' From this milder meaning, expressive of compensation and commodities exchanged, comes the pakeha use of the word signifying money. In settler's parlance `Kahore ti [?] utu' means `I have no money', for to their ears utu is synonymous with `tin', `sugar', and other slang terms used to denote our medium of exchange. <i>(1894,Utu</i>)
