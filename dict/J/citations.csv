The jandal, commonly known as the flip flop in the United Kingdom, the thong in Australia and mainland United States (although since the popularity of the thong swimwear/underwear, flip flop is bcoming more common in the US) and the slippah or slipper in Hawaii, has been around for thousands of years. Flip flops first appeared in the UK around 2000 years ago, most likelt brought over by the Romans, who probably got them from the Egyptians, who had them from around 3000BC. The Allied Forces took the Japanese Zori sandal (which the Japanese had been wearing for thousands of years) back to the US after World War II, and it gained popularity among California's surfers in the early 1950s. All of which happened before Yock abbreviated the name to jandal.","John Davies, Exeter, England"
