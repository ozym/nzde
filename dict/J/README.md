>  <b>1948</b> The Story of the saddleback would not be complete without some reference to the mystery which for many years surrounded the so-called `Jack-bird'. This bird, once thought to be a different from the saddleback, is of the same size, but of a uniform coffee-brown colour. One writer has likened the colours of the saddleback to ink and cocoa respectively, and that of the `Jack-bird' to the colour of ink stirred into cocoa! It has now been established that the `Jack-bird' is really a juvenile saddleback in its first year plumage, and that later the full plumage and larger cheek-wattles are developed. This applies to the South Island saddleback only; since the first edition of this album was published it has been discovered that the North Island saddleback is a distinct sub-species and has no `Jack-bird' plumage in its juvenile stage, but has the saddle from the time of leaving the nest.

## jandal
 
 <i>n.</i> (trademark) a light usually rubber or plastic sandal with a thong between the big and second toe (also called thong; in Britain usually called flip-flop). [probably a blend of Japanese and sandal] [[OEDS2.] A pair of simple sandals with two straps joined and fitted between two toes; see also thong [from a trade name]. 1981 Feb Avondale College (Auckland) Slang Words in Use (Goldie Brown Collection) jandals 1981 Rangiora High School (Goldie Brown Collection) jandalls: in the dict.] (See [DNZE 1958 cit](../D#dnze-1958-cit))

>  <b>Jul 24, 2004</b> I refer to the claim that the jandal was "invented" by Maurice Yock in the mid 1950s. He may have made up the name and trademarked it, but he did not invent the footwear. The jandal, commonly known as the flip flop in the United Kingdom, the thong in Australia and mainland United States (although since the popularity of the thong swimwear/underwear, flip flop is bcoming more common in the US) and the slippah or slipper in Hawaii, has been around for thousands of years. Flip flops first appeared in the UK around 2000 years ago, most likelt brought over by the Romans, who probably got them from the Egyptians, who had them from around 3000BC. The Allied Forces took the Japanese Zori sandal (which the Japanese had been wearing for thousands of years) back to the US after World War II, and it gained popularity among California's surfers in the early 1950s. All of which happened before Yock abbreviated the name to jandal. (Listener (New Zealand Listener),7) [NOTES: John Davies, Exeter, England]

>  <b>Jan 1, 2002</b> Jandal, like champagne, like Hoover, should never be used as a generic term. Jandals, flip-flops, thongs - they're all a ghastly sort of topless shoe hitched to the foot with a piece of rubber between big and second toes, but call a common thong a Jandal and you're in for trouble with the Napier company holding the trademark. Jandals were born in the 1950s, an adaptation of casual slip-ons worn by the Japanese team at the 1956 Olympic Games. (Evening Post,10)

[Maurice] Yock, a New Zealand sales rep who worked for his grandfather's company, was travelling around Asia in the late '50s when he spotted a style of footwear in Japan. The "jandal" - from "Japanese sandal" - went into production in a garage in Te Papapa in 1957, and Jandals Ltd was born, a brand name specific to this country. (Sunday Star Times,A5)

## Japie/Jaapie
 
 <i>n.</i> a South African [Letter from Corrie Rademeyer]

>  <b>Mar 25, 1999</b> I am intrigued by the word "japie", sometimes "jaapie" which is often used in New Zealand for South Africans. I have asked South African expatriates about the word and their theory was that it stemmed from a characteristic pronunciation of "yeah", a word they often use. Some believe it is an ironic pun on "yuppie". In Afrikaans, the name Japie is a diminutive or affectionate form of Jaap or Jacobus.. In everyday use, a japie is a dolt or simpleton. It is often used together with the word "plaas" as in "plaasjapie", which means a yokel or country bumpkin... If the word is South African in origin, "jaapie" would be the wrong spelling. The "a" as in japie is a long vowel. (Letter,00)

>  <b>Apr 12, 1997</b> Perhaps we shouldn't forget that New Zealanders often use the term Jaapie to describe a South African, as they would a Pom for an Englishman or a Yank for an American.

In the end nearest the tree was bolted a forked piece of steel made by a blacksmith, which had a point or boss on the upper side. This was secured to the board by small bolts and covered with sacking. The bushman commonly cut a neat hole in the tree about level with his breast, or even higher. Into this little chamber the bushman pushed the steel head of the jigger, elevating the tail and striking his axe into the trunk, and aided by vines climbed up till he stood upright on the jigger, whose boss, or spike, pushed into the upper part of the axe cavity, made a springy and secure chopping platform. An expert man would easily cut his stance and attach his jigger in three minutes - a very much quicker method than the old style of collecting tree fern trunks and building a platform.

They worked on the principle of the African Cape Cart. The pole (shaft) was attached to the collars of the horses. Tom McClurg of Te Whakuru made the first `jogger' in Chathams, about 1940.

(2) That `Jolly' is a corruption of an Indian word - a case similar to `Blighty.' Anyway, who was Johnston? The only facts which seem to be agreed on are that the place was never `Johnston's,' and certainly never `jolly.' (Quick March,11)

## joint venture
 
 <i>n.</i> meaning particular to a type of fishing operation that existed between the declaration of the 200-mile exclusive economic zone in 1978, and 1986 when the QUOTA MANAGEMENT SYSTEM was introduced; during which foreign fishing vessels entered into business arrangments with New Zealand companies to gain the right to fish the zone. (See [New Zealandisation](../N#new-zealandisation))

>  <b>2004</b> <i>JOHNSON</i> 267 The basic principle was that joint ventures should fish stocks not already being taken by New Zealand fishermen, and not likely to be fished by them in the near future. The fishing of these stocks should require catching capacity and know-how beyond what was available in New Zealand.<i>Ibid.</i> 268 The 72-metre <i>Banshu Maru</i> No. 8 began fishing offshore waters in 1979 for a joint venture between Watties and the Japanese fishing company Taiyo, and operations like this provided some fish for local processing and built up New Zealand's offshore fish catch. (Hooked)

>  <b>May 11, 2002</b> To complicate the issue, some New Zealand fishing companies enter joint venture agreements with foreign boat and crews, often better equipped than the local fleet for catching fish such as orange roughy and oreo in deeper waters far offshore. (Dominion Weekend Magazine,3)

>  <b>1984</b> <i>MUNRO, D.J. & P.J.</i> Government eventually recognised the potential of the outer fisheries by extending influence to the 200 miles waters of New Zealand, which, incidentally, had been fished for years by foreigners, and there appeared large "Joint Venture" vessels, owned an operated by foreign and local firms, which, so locals aver, occasionally intrude into the local fish stocks inside the zones.

This word crept in to the vocabulary of many Americans Down Under, but they will forget it when they settle down at home again. The American use of the word guy has exactly the same meaning.

>  <b>1948</b> <i>REED</i> After that chance discovery every spear was equipped, at a few inches from the point, with a coil of fine wire, known as `the joker', securely fixed. [to enable the spear to go into the ground easier, and traces of bodies touched to be brought to the surface for examination]. (Gumdigger, The,50) [NOTES: [also in Reed Story of Kauri Gum - check]]

>  <b>1972</b> <i>REED</i> The gum-spear, a slender, rapier-like instrument, fitted with an ordinary spade handle, varied in length from about three feet for use in shallow ground, to twenty-five or more for working deep swamps. Some time after its introduction, the spear came to be fitted with what was called the `joker,' or `toggle'. This was a coil of fine wire, bound round the spear [50] a few inches from the point. It allowed the spear to be thrust into the ground with the minimum of resistance, there being no `drag' on the shaft. It is said that the forerunner of the `joker' was discovered by accident. A digger, pushing his spear into the ground, found that it had penetrated a boot-eyelet, and was surprised to find that, instead of forming an obstruction, the spear penetrated the ground more easily; the coil of fine wire was devised as an improvement. An experienced digger could detect at once, by the feel, and the resistance met by the spear, whether he had struck timber, a stone or gum. (Gumdiggers, The,49)

The length of the spears varied from (say) 1 metre to something up to 3 or 4 metres, for sounding/probing for swamp gum. ...
