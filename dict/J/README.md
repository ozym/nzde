Quote: The Story of the saddleback would not be complete without some reference to the mystery which for many years surrounded the so-called `Jack-bird'. This bird, once thought to be a different from the saddleback, is of the same size, but of a uniform coffee-brown colour. One writer has likened the colours of the saddleback to ink and cocoa respectively, and that of the `Jack-bird' to the colour of ink stirred into cocoa! It has now been established that the `Jack-bird' is really a juvenile saddleback in its first year plumage, and that later the full plumage and larger cheek-wattles are developed. This applies to the South Island saddleback only; since the first edition of this album was published it has been discovered that the North Island saddleback is a distinct sub-species and has no `Jack-bird' plumage in its juvenile stage, but has the saddle from the time of leaving the nest.

There were generally two players ... who each sought to deflect the point of the pocket knife from certain parts of the body by a flick of the hand in such a way that the blade would stick firmly into the ground. ... Every movement had to be done three times. [172] Typical movements were: (1) Place the open pocket knife (loose) [name of movement] [sic] on the closed knuckles of the right hand, point the knife towards the thumb, then with a quick upward flick of the hand to the left, deflect the point of the knife into the ground.

Quote: The critics will no doubt note that to oozle and to trickle, which denoted much slower modes of locomotion, were comparatively little [30] used, and will not be surprised that Wellington trampers are sometimes afflicted with perspidrip, or describe themselves as jagged. Jagged (one syllable), worn out by exertion, exhausted, no doubt has some relation to the English dialect on the jag, a drunken spree, and the American jagged, tipsy, and also owes something to jiggered.

Quote: I refer to the claim that the jandal was "invented" by Maurice Yock in the mid 1950s. He may have made up the name and trademarked it, but he did not invent the footwear. The jandal, commonly known as the flip flop in the United Kingdom, the thong in Australia and mainland United States (although since the popularity of the thong swimwear/underwear, flip flop is bcoming more common in the US) and the slippah or slipper in Hawaii, has been around for thousands of years. Flip flops first appeared in the UK around 2000 years ago, most likelt brought over by the Romans, who probably got them from the Egyptians, who had them from around 3000BC. The Allied Forces took the Japanese Zori sandal (which the Japanese had been wearing for thousands of years) back to the US after World War II, and it gained popularity among California's surfers in the early 1950s. All of which happened before Yock abbreviated the name to jandal.

Quote: Jandal, like champagne, like Hoover, should never be used as a generic term. Jandals, flip-flops, thongs - they're all a ghastly sort of topless shoe hitched to the foot with a piece of rubber between big and second toes, but call a common thong a Jandal and you're in for trouble with the Napier company holding the trademark. Jandals were born in the 1950s, an adaptation of casual slip-ons worn by the Japanese team at the 1956 Olympic Games.

Quote: They've been an icon of Kiwi slobbery since the '50s but in the summer of 2001, the jandal has become a hot fashion item, far removed from the grubby rubber models sported by beer-gutted blokes at barbies.... [Maurice] Yock, a New Zealand sales rep who worked for his grandfather's company, was travelling around Asia in the late '50s when he spotted a style of footwear in Japan. The "jandal" - from "Japanese sandal" - went into production in a garage in Te Papapa in 1957, and Jandals Ltd was born, a brand name specific to this country.

Quote: For the jandal, that local instiution, is as Kiwi as ju-jitsu... It is a sole and a strap. The sole has an off-white veneer. The underside is anaemic blue or anaemic red. So is the strap. That strap is stamped with a crude motif and is held in place by three little plugs. And that's it. The lot. The jandal.

Quote: I am intrigued by the word "japie", sometimes "jaapie" which is often used in New Zealand for South Africans. I have asked South African expatriates about the word and their theory was that it stemmed from a characteristic pronunciation of "yeah", a word they often use. Some believe it is an ironic pun on "yuppie". In Afrikaans, the name Japie is a diminutive or affectionate form of Jaap or Jacobus.. In everyday use, a japie is a dolt or simpleton. It is often used together with the word "plaas" as in "plaasjapie", which means a yokel or country bumpkin... If the word is South African in origin, "jaapie" would be the wrong spelling. The "a" as in japie is a long vowel.

Quote: A jigger was simply a slab of white pine or rimu, axe-trimmed to a diameter of about six inches by three inches deep, and slightly thinner toward the extremity. In the end nearest the tree was bolted a forked piece of steel made by a blacksmith, which had a point or boss on the upper side. This was secured to the board by small bolts and covered with sacking. The bushman commonly cut a neat hole in the tree about level with his breast, or even higher. Into this little chamber the bushman pushed the steel head of the jigger, elevating the tail and striking his axe into the trunk, and aided by vines climbed up till he stood upright on the jigger, whose boss, or spike, pushed into the upper part of the axe cavity, made a springy and secure chopping platform. An expert man would easily cut his stance and attach his jigger in three minutes - a very much quicker method than the old style of collecting tree fern trunks and building a platform.

Quote: As [the diggers] descried us approaching on the rocks, a simultaneous cry of `Joe! Joe!' was raised. This is a popular cry on the New Zealand diggings and is used to hail any `new chums' who may appear. It had its origin in the Australian diggings, where licences were granted to all who held claims, and those who worked without were liable to be apprehended and punished. When the police came upon the ground, to inspect licences, the cry of `Joe!' was raised, and whenever the pass-word was given a thousand voices echoed the cry, until it passed over the fields, when those who had no licences made their escape as quickly as possible.

(2) That `Jolly' is a corruption of an Indian word - a case similar to `Blighty.' Anyway, who was Johnston?

Quote: 267 The basic principle was that joint ventures should fish stocks not already being taken by New Zealand fishermen, and not likely to be fished by them in the near future.

Quote: The gum-spear, a slender, rapier-like instrument, fitted with an ordinary spade handle, varied in length from about three feet for use in shallow ground, to twenty-five or more for working deep swamps. Some time after its introduction, the spear came to be fitted with what was called the `joker,' or `toggle'. This was a coil of fine wire, bound round the spear [50] a few inches from the point. It allowed the spear to be thrust into the ground with the minimum of resistance, there being no `drag' on the shaft. It is said that the forerunner of the `joker' was discovered by accident. A digger, pushing his spear into the ground, found that it had penetrated a boot-eyelet, and was surprised to find that, instead of forming an obstruction, the spear penetrated the ground more easily; the coil of fine wire was devised as an improvement. An experienced digger could detect at once, by the feel, and the resistance met by the spear, whether he had struck timber, a stone or gum.

Quote: Numbers of Americans who spent sufficient time in New Zealand found themselves adopting a word from which escape is almost impossible. It is none other than joker ..... New Zealanders, however, have given it a wider meaning; a joker is simply a man, and he is not necessarily a humorous fellow ..... Thus a New Zealander will say, `Who's that joker?' ...... This word crept in to the vocabulary of many Americans Down Under, but they will forget it when they settle down at home again. The American use of the word guy has exactly the same meaning.

Quote: Among colloquialisms, joker (32)[per 500,000 counted words in Queensland] in the sense of `man' is not confined to Australia, though more frequent there than in England. In the Queenland count it was less common than chap (409) or bloke (176), but it would be likely to rank higher in New Zealand, where it is very common not only alone but in the phrases you jokers and a decent joker (a general term of approval). It is used (repeated as he) as an equivalent of an absolute indefinite pronoun, corresponding to standard one. `They ask one if one is serious' becomes `They ask a joker if he is serious'. With a negative verb it replaces no one. `No one can remember everything' would be colloquially `a joker can't remember everything' '

In Perano whaling practice, it mostly referred to an `outsider', `stranger', or `non-whaler', who was deemed to have brought bad luck to their whaling. The Jonah might be blamed for the non-sighting of whales. Jonahs were never welcomed at the Perano whaling lookout, or on board any Perano ships. Not all strangers were regarded as Jonahs; some, in fact, who helped bring good luck were credited with being good omens.
