There are scarcely two districts, a few miles apart, in which the same name is applied to the same tree, and a similar result may be obtained by consulting two bushmen in the same bush. With a view to obviating this difficulty Mr Kirk suggests `the adoption of new names based of the obvious characteristics of foliage [e.g.] for Fagus fusca `tooth-leaved beech'; for Fagus solandri `entire-leaved beech' etc. [This is unsuitable as foliage varies] I would suggest the retention of the common Otago names Fagus fusca - Red birch ; F. solandri - Black-heart birch ; F Menziesii - Silver birch.
