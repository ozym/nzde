Quote: From an article First Echelon Reunion by Arthur Helm. The use of the word `echelon' in the sense of First, Second or Third Echelon has puzzled many people, for though it is a military term it does not normally denote a `contingent.' Echelon refers to the position of an army in the form of steps or parallel lines ... A new name was sought for Second World War soldiers, and `echelon' was the word chosen. It was first used in this context on August 29, 1939 ... While in the Middle East - in September 1940 - an attempt was made to alter it to `contingent,' but thiswas not successful, and `echelon' it remained.

## "eh"


WordClass: exclamation
SenseNumber: 2
Definition: In NZ the general English interjectional interrogative particle often inviting assent (OED2 2. `Wasn't it lucky, eh?'), and possibly the interrogative use as a request for the repetition or explanation of something that has just been said (OED2 3 colloq. or vulgar `Eh? What's that, Sackville?), possibly reinforced in some areas by a use of the Maori interrogative n&emacr. produces a typical and frequent form: positive statement + particle eh? or eh! You're going to town, eh(?) J. Devanny Old Savage 1927 uses both the general English (negative) and the NZ (positive) use as part of her style (check pages 104 `aye'). Cf 1943 Bennett English in NZ 91 In the mild imperative with eh - as in `Give us a packet of cigarettes, eh' - it is tempting to see a reflexion of that egalitarianism that frequently strikes the visitor (who misses the respectful`sir').

Quote: `Emigrant' and `Colonist' are used by some as simply convertible terms; though the life of every settler compared with itself, the condition of every colony, refute the mistake. Others, who are aware of the great difference that exists between the two, are yet very far from knowing wherein it consists. They sometimes speak of emigrants ... and colonists as two distinct classes, or rather, castes of men. One who flies from his native land driven by want ... who sets his life on a venture because it is worth so little ... these are Emigrants; while farmers, tradesmen, gentlefolks, those who have something, ... all, in short, who can make up a purse full enough to depart respectably, ... all who have prospects however distant; these are Colonists. I remember well on board the Charlotte Jane on the voyage out to New Zealand, certain friends of mine always called the common passengers - `the emigrants'. Evidently they considered themselves in all respects above the condition of `emigrants.' ... emigrant a term of reproach.

There are scarcely two districts, a few miles apart, in which the same name is applied to the same tree, and a similar result may be obtained by consulting two bushmen in the same bush. With a view to obviating this difficulty Mr Kirk suggests `the adoption of new names based of the obvious characteristics of foliage [e.g.] for Fagus fusca `tooth-leaved beech'; for Fagus solandri `entire-leaved beech' etc. [This is unsuitable as foliage varies] I would suggest the retention of the common Otago names Fagus fusca - Red birch ; F. solandri - Black-heart birch ; F Menziesii - Silver birch.

Quote: notes on Mongrel Talking of dogs: An `eye-dog' is a specialised type of header which works very quietly, never taking its eyes off the sheep it is trying to pen. Sheep men generally seem to think the dog hypnotises the sheep into being penned quietly. I believe that the fixity of its gaze and its complete concentration enable it to detect and counter any rebelliousness on the part of the sheep before the sheep have quite made up their minds.
