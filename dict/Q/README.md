 <i>n.</i> [1969 Coastal Development. Proceedings of a Symposium held in Auckland on 29th and 30th August, 1969. It is in this, in a paper by J.D. O'Brien, Commissioner of Crown Lands, that the information about Cass decreeing there should be a chain in 1851 is first stated to my knowledge. Haven't tracked down the original proclamation or by-law by Cass].]

>  [Hdg] The Queen's Chain (Not a limpwrist ornament). <i>Ibid.</i> 15. In manyplaces in New Zealand the Queen's Chain,as the coastal reserve became knownbecause of its nominal width, has beenthe foundation of coastal landsubdivision, but in others it has not...The fault lies not in the laws but inourselves that we have crowded the coast,and the Queen's Chain concept is asappropriate right now to the new idealismof environmental management as it was tothe nineteenth century problems of landgrabbing, coastal shipping by sail, rivercommunication, and lack of roads. <i>(Dec 1977,Landscape, The,5 : 14</i>)

>  The Queen's Chain Promotion group wasformed because it saw a dangerous trenddeveloping - a breaching of the intentand purpose of the Royal Charter toGovernor Hobson in 1840. <i>(Aug 1989,NZ Parks & Recreation,IV(3) : 5</i>)

>  Prime Minister Geoffrey Palmer yesterdaysaid the Government had no plans torestrict public access to the Queen'schain... It's an important part of NewZealand's history. <i>(Nov 29, 1989,Dominion,26</i>)

>  The Queen's Chain is a colloquial term for all the above forms of public reservation, nominally one chain or 20 metres wide, and comprises the accumulative, if inadequate, legacy of official action to implement Queen Victoria's instructions of 1840... Extension to riverbeds and beaches of the Queen's Chain founding principle that river banks and coastal margins shall be free from "disposition" to private interests is essential; otherwise they are liable to be literally sold from under the public foot. <i>(Apr 6, 2002,Listener (New Zealand Listener),8</i>)

>  Access along all our water margins is a myth. It has been estimated that a Queen's Chain exists only on about 60 per cent of our significant rivers, lake shores and coastline. The term describes a legal variety of strips of land along water margins that are held in public ownership. These include marginal strips, roads (whether formed or not) and esplanade reserves. <i>(Mar 11, 2000,Listener (New Zealand Listener),48</i>)

>  Largely unfettered and unhindered access around and along margins of the sea and waterways - commonly thought of by the public as "the Queen's Chain" - is dear to the hearts of most New Zealanders. <i>Ibid.</i> Changes proposed under the bill will put barriers in the way of.. creating a comprehensive "Queen's Chain" system throughout New Zealand. <i>(Mar 14, 1993,Sunday Times (NZ),6</i>)

>  Finlay Macdonald and Grahame Anderson.. completely miss the problem of the mythical Queen's Chain. In 1840 Queen Victoria instructed Governor Hobson to "set aside for recreation and amusement ... on the sea coast or in the neighbourhood of navigable streams ... reserves" - and "we do strictly enjoin and require you that you do not on any account, or on any pretence whatsoever, grant, convey or demise to any person or persons any of the lands specified as fit to be reserved as aforesesaid, nor permit or suffer any such lands to be occupied by any private person for any private purposes". This admirable instruction was not adopted until the 1892 Land Act, by which time much land adjoining riverbeds and the coast had been taken up. Since then.. the few lengths where the Queen's Chain was set aside are now in the riverbeds or out to sea, because they were fixed on survey plans and not moveable. <i>(Feb 23, 2002,Listener (New Zealand Listener),8</i>)

>  Possibly all that stands between us and a Europeanised vista of private beaches and exclusive access rights is the good old Queen's Chain. <i>(Jan 19, 2002,Listener (New Zealand Listener),5</i>)

>  The 20-metre strip above the foreshore, known colloquially as the Queen's Chain, is the area above the spring high water mark. About a third of the New Zealand coast does not have a Queen's Chain and a good portion of this belongs to Maori. <i>(May 22, 2004,Listener (New Zealand Listener),8</i>)

>  Within seconds, everyone had gone and the Queen's chain lay undisturbed and invisible once more, but none the less precious for that. The Queen's chain is marked, where applicable, by a line alongside every coast, lake, river and stream on highly detailed cadastral maps. <i>(May 6, 1995,Listener (New Zealand Listener),17</i>)

>  The Queen's Chain allows access up almost all the major streams and riverbeds, however most people accessing the Seaward Kaikoura mountains use the Kowhai and Hapuku River valleys. <i>(Aug 2010,FMC - (Federated Mountain Clubs of NZ) Bulletin,23</i>)

>  On Monday, Samuel Garforth, a slaughterman, was charged by Sergeant McInnes, for obstructing a public thoroughfare, he having erected a slaughter-yard above high-water mark, on what is termed the Queen's Chain, a strip of ground one chain wide, extending from high-water mark inland, and which is by law a public highway. <i>(Aug 24, 1865,West Coast Times,2/3</i>)

>  Our forestry is going too / to Uncle Sam or Timbuctoo. / The Queen's chain too we soon could sell - / the people's rights can go to hell. <i>(May 14, 1990,Listener (New Zealand Listener),114</i>)
