<b>1</b> <i>n.</i> The seashore as a place for an outing.. -->1. [W3] In NZ not only the word for `the shore of the sea' (OED2 sb 3 citations connote a littoral and a literal meaning), but also the usual word for British seaside, the beach as a place of enjoyment or recreation (seaside has an unidiomatic, British association even in children's stories), cf beach cottage: in early days beach had commercial connotations: cf The Beach, beach trader. [Jim Cameron writes: The importance of the beach as a NZ icon suggests that there might be some distinctive NZE compounds. OED has <i>*beach bag, *beach ball, *beach buggy, *beach bum, beach flea, *beachfront, beach grass, beach plum, beach rock, *beachwear</i>. Macquarie 1981 has also <i>beach break</i> (a surfing term), <i>beach hut, beach inspector, *beach mat, *beach robe, beachworm</i> <i>*surf beach</i> - in NZPOD - and <i>*ocean beach</i>. As well I have seen <i>beach music, *beach picnic</i> and <i>beach volleyball</i> recently in overseas publications.

## bulkie
 
<b>1</b> <i>n.</i> shortened form of "bulk tonnage operator" [King (24/3/1999) says bulk tonnage operators were firms which developed from the 1960 in reaction to the then regulations limiting road competition with rail. These firms consolidated small lots of goods into wagon lot, thus creating "bulk" goods (from the Railways perspective) out of much smaller units. Their workers did not in fact "load bulk goods" - it was the result of their working that the goods became "bulk". Such firms still exist; their current formal name is "freight forwarders" although one hears bulk tonnage operatore or "BTO" occasionally. Examples include Mainfreight and Daily Freight... Given that the expanded name of "bulk tonnage operator" is some thirty years older than [your] example, I would be surprised if its contraction is not also somewhere recorded earlier than 1991.]

In the North Island, `a burn' was chiefly applied to clearing away (felled) bush by burning, a burning off (or over) of unwanted bush: that is, to clearing or bringing land into cultivation, not merely to improving pasture. burn off seems chiefly used in this North Island sense (cf bush-burning)) (See [also bush burn](http://../dict/A#also-bush-burn))

<b>1</b> <i>n.</i> From the 1930s at least, according to W.

An inefficient or tyro stoker who built a bad fire had a `burn-out' in the furnace - i.e. the fire went partially out. He was allowed to get away with one of these, but on doing a second, was eased off the ship. Hence it came to mean a bad discharge in general.
