In the basket its maker put a supper, the food cooked at home ... [151] Now on the night of the basket social, all the baskets would be handed in ... They would then be auctioned, and the purchaser of the basket would have the pleasure and the honour of having supper with the provider of the basket. ...

## beach
 
 <i>n.</i> The seashore as a place for an outing.. -->1. [W3] In NZ not only the word for `the shore of the sea' (OED2 sb 3 citations connote a littoral and a literal meaning), but also the usual word for British seaside, the beach as a place of enjoyment or recreation (seaside has an unidiomatic, British association even in children's stories), cf beach cottage: in early days beach had commercial connotations: cf The Beach, beach trader. [Jim Cameron writes: The importance of the beach as a NZ icon suggests that there might be some distinctive NZE compounds. OED has <i>*beach bag, *beach ball, *beach buggy, *beach bum, beach flea, *beachfront, beach grass, beach plum, beach rock, *beachwear</i>. Macquarie 1981 has also <i>beach break</i> (a surfing term), <i>beach hut, beach inspector, *beach mat, *beach robe, beachworm</i> <i>*surf beach</i> - in NZPOD - and <i>*ocean beach</i>. As well I have seen <i>beach music, *beach picnic</i> and <i>beach volleyball</i> recently in overseas publications. [*Known to me as in NZ use or former use also]. <i>Beachfront</i> is tagged in OED as chiefly US, and all citations refer to places outside the UK. It has long been used in NZ.

The latter were on the gravelly river banks which the miners sluiced away bodily for the golden grains ... The former were on the sandy margins of the river, and were often extended by means of `wing-dams' and other ingenious devices far into the rushing waters. In these claims the gold was found lodged in `pockets' or fissures formed by the slate bars ... (Wild Will Enderby,Bk I iv 17)

>  <b>1967</b> <i>MAY</i> Collet's quicksilver plates rapidly became common on the beach-claims although they did not completely supplant the simpler cradle and sluice-box. <i>Ibid.</i> 244 It was a matter of nice judgement. The digger recognized four classes of payable ground: `tucker ground' kept him in food with nothing to spare; a `wages claim' gave him a pound or two above living expenses; a `riser' was a rich claim; and a `piler' or `homeward bounder' the richest of all. Probably most of the `pilers' were beach-claims, where the leads were shallow and rich, the outlay small and provisions cheap because of easy access. (West Coast Gold Rushes,170,1962 ed.)

>  <b>1881</b> <i>BATEMAN</i> The small quantity of gold under the boulders, which lie on the sandy beach [on the West Coast, South Island] is generally supposed by gold prospectors, otherwise termed `beach-combers', to be due to the lifting action of the surf. (Colonists,36)

Also occas. used for species of other general thought to resemble Nothofagus. occas. (usu. overseas usage) New Zealand birch. As with beech, vernacular naming tries to distinguish var. and spp. by ref. to colour of bark, texture of wood or timber, appearance of leaf, etc., but with similar confusion and local variation.

Woe betide us if we referred to birch trees in our correspondence with Head Office: we were reminded that it was <i>beech</i> and given all sorts of advice telling us that the botanical name was something like <i>Fagus fagusti</i>, and so on. Some people are allergic to beech trees and the local name for this allergic condition was birch itch. On one occasion a compensatory claim was sent to Wellington advising that the condition suffered was birch itch. Back came a reprimand about this use of the term birch - it should be <i>beech</i>, Head Office pointed out. Nothing was done about this until one day it came to the notice of our chief. He was quick to reply and acknowledge that the trees were beech, not birch, but the itch suffered by the men was birch itch not beech itch. It was locally named by them, and as far as his staff were concerned they used the term birch itch to describe the allergy caused by beech trees. There was no further comment from the Moguls in Head Office. (Men of the Milford Road,93) [NOTES: (Griffiths Collection)]

>  <b>Sep 16, 1933</b> <i>Birch</i>. Various species of Nothofagus. There are various kinds (white, red, black etc.) of trees in New Zealand called birches. They are all really beeches and the newspapers and forestry people are trying to get them so called, but up country they are still always called birches. Birch (creeks, hill, etc.) is one of the commonest components of local names in the South Island. ([1898 Morris Austral-English], and an unpublished letter to Hunter Brown from Dr Hodgkinson, August 9, 1854.) (Press, The,15) [NOTES: Acland Glossary]



 
 <i>n.</i>

>  <b>1918</b> <i>Fagus Solandri.</i> - The most common name of this tree is `black-birch,' but it has several other names. In the Wellington and Marlborough districts it is called `black-birch'; in Canterbury it is called `black-birch,' `white-birch,' `red-birch,' and `brown-birch'; in Otago it is known as `white-birch,' `black-birch,' or black-heart birch.' Young specimens of this tree that have no dark heart-wood are often called `white-birch.' This tree is a beech, and it would do away with confusion if it was called `black-beech'. <i>Fagus Menziesii. </i>- The commonest name of this tree is `silver-birch,' but it is often called `brown-birch,' `red-birch,' and `white-birch' [308] in different localities. It would be best to call it `silver-beech,'though it is gaining an Australasian reputation as `Southland beech.' <i>Fagus fusca. </i>- In Auckland this tree is called `black-birch'; in Wellington `red-birch'; in Nelson, Marlborough and Westland it is called `brown-birch'; and in Otago it is called both `red-birch' and `bull-birch.' The most suitable name is `red-beech.' (NZ Journal of Science & Technology,1/307)

>  <b>1876</b> The utmost confusion prevails among the common names of the birches. There are scarcely two districts, a few miles apart, in which the same name is applied to the same tree, and a similar result may be obtained by consulting two bushmen in the same bush. With a view to obviating this difficulty Mr Kirk suggests `the adoption of new names based of the obvious characteristics of foliage [e.g.] for Fagus fusca `tooth-leaved beech' ... (TrNZI,64) [NOTES: (Blair)]

>  <b>1885</b> [this cit. not spec. repeated in individual entries] [In Oxford Forest] I learned that the tree [F. solandri, entire-leaved beech ] was termed [red, brown, white, black, and yellow] birch at different stages of its growth, but the application of these terms differed greatly; perhaps Black Birch was most generally applied to the mature condition before decay commenced, and White birch to the young state; but there were too many exceptions to allow the names to be anything but misleading. (TrNZI,17/300) [NOTES: (Kirk, NZ Beeches)]

>  <b>1891</b> The perversity with which the true `beeches' have become popularly known as `birches,' and different kinds of `mapau' as `maples - a popular name which includes small trees of widely distinct Natural Order, is enough to fill with despair any botanist who desires to foster a system of popular names that will be free from misleading and inaccurate suggestions. (NZ Journal of Science,1/50)

>  <b>1926</b> '... the term birch may be regarded as a generic name applied by bushmen to any small-leaved tree, and qualified by the prefixes `black', `white' or `red' at the caprice of the individual or as may be suggested by the colour of its foliage, bark or timber.' So the term `black birch' was in many districts applied to Pittosporum tenuifolium [ ] and to Weinmannia racemosa [Kamahi] in Otago - the latter tree being also known as `brown birch' or `red birch.' Myrsine Urvillei [ ] was known as `red birch', and Carpodetus serratus [ ] and Quintinia serrata [ ] as `white birch.' It was principally to the trees of the species Nothofagus (then known a Fagus), that the term `birch' was applied, and a distinguishing of the various kinds by the prefixing of a descriptive word was a step in the right direction; but in this instance the step was on a path that led to a quagmire. To take only the instance of N. Solandri (formerly Fagus Solandri). [v. 1885 Kirk] ... The confusion created has been endless ; it has at times even resulted in commercial loss ; [v. (Morris) 1889 Kirk `Forest Flora of NZ p.91] yet so strong is habit that confusion was preferred before a change of name. And, indeed, the bushmen might well ask what name they should adopt ; for the scientists came and added to the confusion by pointing out that the trees usually called `birch' were not birch at all, but `beech' - when a fresh crop of names resulted.: `black beech', `red beech', `dusky beech', etc. The scientists themselves, however, in calling the species Nothofagus, `beech', took care - that is, usually took care - to make the distinguishing prefix one that would not lead to a repetition of the old confusion. N. Solanderi was accordingly called `entire-leaved beech' ; N. Cliffortioides, `mountain beech' ; N. Menziesii, `round-leaved beech' ; N. fusca `tooth-leaved beech'. It was some time before even these names were agreed upon ; and `silver beech' finally took the place of `round-leaved beech' for N. Menziesii. A note may here be made of the fact that, whilst the entire-leaved beech was Fagus Solandri, on Fagus being changed to Nothofagus, Solandri was altered to Solanderi ; but this has been altered back again to Solandri ; for that was the original and not incorrect spelling of the word. (TrNZI,56-57/663) [NOTES: Andersen Popular Names ff Kirk in 1875 [Reports on the Durability of N.Z. Timber 16]]

>  <b>1940</b> <i>LAING & BLACKWELL</i> ... it is perhaps futile to hope that the more exact name [beech] will become popular ; but we might at least expect some consistent nomenclature to be adopted through the islands. At present the various species are designated almost indifferently, white, red, black, silver birch etc. What is white birch in one part of the country may be black in another ... The use of the name <i>birch</i> in place of <i>beech</i> is inexcusable, though ... N. Menziesii ... [shows] some external resemblance to the English birch. (NZ Plants,136)

>  <b>Mar 11, 1972</b> Colour Coding [heading] ... St Patrick's Day sports organiser, Mr Lyn Thompson yesterday inquired about the difference between red, black and brown birch. It was `clearly' explained for him by a prominent axeman, Mr Bill Evans. The bark of the red birch is silver, but the timber is pink when it's green. Brown birch often has black bark, but the green timber is red. Sometimes the bark of the black birch is white, but the timber is yellow and sometimes it's brown when it's green.

Some people are allergic to beech trees and the local name for this allergic condition was birch itch. On one occasion a compensatory claim was sent to Wellington advising that the condition suffered was birch itch. Back came a reprimand about this use of the term birch - it should be <i>beech</i>, Head Office pointed out. Nothing was done about this until one day it came to the notice of our chief. He was quick to reply and acknowledge that the trees were beech, not birch, but the itch suffered by the men was birch itch not beech itch. It was locally named by them, and as far as his staff were concerned they used the term birch itch to describe the allergy caused by beech trees.

## Black Budget
 
 <i>n.</i> The name given first by opponents, and then generally, to Finance Minister Nordmeyer's deflationary budget of 1958 and thence to any such budget (also used of an earlier budget); Charles Ransom comments (Nov 1986): referred to occas. by journalists but does not seem to have entered the language as meaning `deflationary budget'.

>  <b>Aug 2, 1999</b> June 26 [1958]. Minister of Finance Arnold Nordmeyer presented his first Budget, increasing taxes on beer, spirits, cigarettes and tobacco. Known ever after as the Black Budget, it was a response to a balance of payments crisis and introduced cheap housing loans and the Pay-As-You-Earn (Paye) tax system. (Evening Post,5)

>  <b>1976</b> <i>SINCLAIR</i> In 1930 J.G. Coates had called Ward's budget `the Black Budget' [PD 1931, 229, 88] - but that was long forgotten. This time the label stuck. Nordmeyer's budget [of June 1958] was remembered as `the black budget' for many years. It can be argued that it was good for `the country'. For the government it was a suicidal mistake. It was the biggest blunder in Nash's political career. Although he was not immediately and directly responsible, he was the leader and did not say `No'. (Nash,309)

>  <b>Oct 1963</b> Mr Lake and the government are lucky that the country's condition permitted them to avoid a Black Budget. (Comment,175)

>  <b>1980</b> <i>NEAVE</i> It would not be an exaggeration to say that [Mr Nordmeyer] was respected as much outside the Labour Party, as he was within it, ... and although his `Black Budget' was known as the cause of the fall of the Labour Government, it was recognised as the anti-dote for the economic situation at that time.

>  <b>Jun 22, 2003</b> On June 26, 1958, Minister of Finance Arnold Nordmeyer presented his first budget. It has gone down in political history as the "black budget" and it helped consign its author to political purgatory... In a statement issued on the night of the budget speech the two presidents of the North and South Island Motor Unions called it "black Thursday" and Federation of Labour strongman Fintan Patrick Walsh was soon labelling it the "black budget".

These black layers are often one or two inches thick, and repose upon coarse quartzose sands. As soon as a storm has subsided, the `beachers' or `surfers' as they are called, examine the coastline near their houses. When they come upon one of the rich spots, the fine particles of gold being often visible to the naked eye, they at once remove the black layer of sand out of the reach of the tide, and wash it when convenient.

These tailings are treated in berdans with extra quicksilver and ground up. The berdans now in use at the Thames ... are generally five feet in diameter ... At one time a couple of rotating balls were considered sufficient for the amount of crushing required; now, the general practice is to have a loose ball as well as a stationary one attached to a chain, and it is called a drag ball; this drag does more work than a loose ball ... for the drag grinds the bowl as much as the tailings.

Very seldom was harness used, and then without winkers, and it was called branks. The pulling strain came on the bows, and a yoke joined two bows and went over each neck of a pair of bullocks. If there were five pairs, say, a chain ran from the yoke of the first pair to the yoke of the second pair, and another chain from the second to the third, and another chain from the third to the fourth. These chains were lighter between the first pairs and heavier as you got further back. The two rear bullocks were yoked to the pole of the dray or waggon. As there were no reins, the driving was all by commands and cracking the whip. The calls were `Get up' or `Gee up' to start, `Whoa' to stop, `Come here' to turn to left, and `Gee off' to turn right. If you came to a sharp corner, you would often say persuasively, `Way! Way! Come here.'' There is a general impression that bullocks could not be successfully driven without roaring oaths and curses at them, but this idea is a relic of early-day humour. (Early Runholding in Otago,42)

## bulkie
 
 <i>n.</i> shortened form of "bulk tonnage operator" [King (24/3/1999) says bulk tonnage operators were firms which developed from the 1960 in reaction to the then regulations limiting road competition with rail. These firms consolidated small lots of goods into wagon lot, thus creating "bulk" goods (from the Railways perspective) out of much smaller units. Their workers did not in fact "load bulk goods" - it was the result of their working that the goods became "bulk". Such firms still exist; their current formal name is "freight forwarders" although one hears bulk tonnage operatore or "BTO" occasionally. Examples include Mainfreight and Daily Freight... Given that the expanded name of "bulk tonnage operator" is some thirty years older than [your] example, I would be surprised if its contraction is not also somewhere recorded earlier than 1991.]

Astounded I listened to this blue-eyed son of Albion and was at last impelled to ask him why he cursed so horribly; it could serve no purpose and only made the beast more stubborn. `You don't understand, Sir,' the young man answered. `I'm only speaking the bullock language. The animal certainly wouldn't understand or obey me if I spoke to him as I would to my horse. The bullock has been brought up to carry in this way, and if I want to get on fast, I've got to talk to him like this.' To this argument advanced by the driver with a good-natured smile I naturally could find no reply. I refer it to the linguists to enrol this new language in the appropriate family of dialects.

In the DNZE p. 103 you deal with the word 'bung' which can mean become useless, broken, ruined and 'bung out' meaning to die. But your earliest reference for these words is 1887 and the origin is given as Australian pidgin. I wonder what the earliest Australian reference is and whether Rangihaeata would have picked it up from this source so early. It seems that if he was using it, then it already had some currency in NZ by then." Harry Orsman replied that "I think (and I can recall this from the limits of an imperfect memory) that this use in early Maori-Pakeha New Zealand relations was a pidgin word from 'bang(a)bang' meaning to shoot. It wasn't related to the Aboriginal word usually spelled 'bung' 'dead', etc."]

>  <b>1956</b> <i>GRAHAM</i> GREENBONE, BUTTERFISH, KELP SALMON, or KELPIE (MARARI) <i>Coridodax pullus</i> (Bloch and Schneider) ... The name Greenbone is given on account of the bones being a bright green colour, which is so permanent as to with-stand boiling or bleaching. ... The name kelp-fish is given on account of its habit of feeding on kelp or seaweed, and also because it likes to make its home among kelp. In such a habitat it has both food and a favourite home. Kelp-salmon is given for two reasons. The first part, kelp, is explained in the last paragraph, while the second half, salmon, is because the fish is not unlike a Salmon in shape, so much so that new chums who caught this fish have been under the impression they had caught the protected introduced Salmon, but of that later in this chapter. But why this dark coloured fish should receive the name Butterfish I am unable to say. It is certainly not as some people suggest because it needs butter with it when cooked or eaten. In Auckland the fish known to South Islanders as Spotty (<i>Pseudolabrus celidotus</i>) is called Butterfish on account of its bright golden colouring on the lower parts of the body and fins fancifully resembling the colour of butter. The name Kelpie, of course, is derived from its habit of living amidst kelp and it is easily understood how the `ie' was tacked on by fishermen. (NZ Fishes: An Identification Guide,261)

>  <b>1957</b> <i>PARROTT</i> The Butterfish is very similar in form, and is related to, the Kelpfish (<i>Odax vittatus</i>), which is also a brightly-coloured species and found in similar situations, feeding on kelp and other marine plants in rocky localities. <i>Ibid.</i> 130 It is unfortunate that the Butterfish has been given a variety of local names which have originated either from their habit of associating with kelp, their body form, or from the colour of their bones, as for example, Kelpfish, Kelp-salmon, Greenbone, and several other names not so easy to explain. Butterfish or Greenbone are possibly the more generally used names for this fish but it should be remembered that in the North Island the Spotty (<i>Pseudolabrus celidotus</i>), a very different fish, is related to the Butterfish there is superficially little resemblance between the two species. <i>Ibid.</i> 169 Butterfish Coridodax pullus Greenbone; Kelp Salmon; Kelpi; Kelpfish (Sea Anglers' Fishes of NZ,129)
