'Chaffy' and 'baggy' raised a smile merely, but 'straw walloper' tickled everybody except the witness, who glanced around with an air of pity on the laughing faces of those who were ignorant of the designation of the man who attends to the straw elevator. Some machines, it appears, boast of two 'straw wallopers', others are content with one'.

On the first we need not dwell, but a little information about the latter may be of interest. A similar infection has been met with elsewhere, and in Gyppo Land is known as `magnune', whilst away in our own sunny island I think `dippy' about covered it. Here we have a more or less insidious form of the disease, and no one with six months' residence to his credit may hope to escape. There are two varieties of the disease, malignant and benign. In the latter form the symptoms are easily recognised, and are amenable to treatment; but with the malignant type the victims, quite unconscious of infection, blindly affirm their condition to be normal, This form of the malady has several unfortunate features and is incurable. The percentage in our unit is very high.

Quote: <i>bank and bank</i>. A river runs bank and bank when all the streams join into one; i.e., when in high flood (Butler A First Year in Canterbury Settlement], p. 73). Hence a banker. The expressions were probably introduced by the shagroons. [Morris Austral English] gives a banker as meaning a river full to the top of its banks. New Zealand rivers, of course, do not get as full as that.

Quote: I take a good deal more notice of the Bank of New Zealand than I do of the other banking institutions. It is for the reasons that it is our own national establishment, and every man, woman, and child, is interested in its welfare and affected by its management. Virtually, it belongs to the public; the shareholders, nominally the proprietors, are merely trustees. My view may be extreme on this point but I believe the day is not far distant when the people of New Zealand will take possession of that bank in their own name, and tax all the others out of the country - a protection policy that would pay well.

These ribs or dyke-like masses are the `hard bars' of the miners. In some cases, however, these `hard bars' are probably due to dykes. <i>Ibid.</i> 111The `hard bars' of mining terminology are in most cases merely remnants of less-altered rock, but occasionally as in the case of the `bar' mentioned in the Golden Pah mine, they owe their existence to intrusives.

Quote: His book included an account of "barrelling", or organised beatings... The cadet said time and place of barrelling would be spread among the cadets, and the staff would disappear.

Shaving cream, toothpaste, nugget and even excrement were rubbed on the victim who was then hosed off.

Quote: The relative merits of superphosphate and basic slag for pasture top-dressing are much discussed in certain districts, particularly North Taranaki and North Auckland. Many experienced farmers are firmly of the opinion that slagged pastures have better milk production and fattening capacities than ones treated with superphosphate. How much this may be due to a greater effect from slag, how much to some effect on the mineral content of the herbage, and how much due to management it is impossible to say.

The `bay' refers to the bay window (naturally enough); and also, some say, to San Francisco Bay. It was (and is) a house form common in that city; and it may well have spread to New Zealand from there.

Notes: Jim Cameron writes: The importance of the beach as a NZ icon suggests that there might be some distinctive NZE compounds. OED has <i>*beach bag, *beach ball, *beach buggy, *beach bum, beach flea, *beachfront, beach grass, beach plum, beach rock, *beachwear</i>. Macquarie 1981 has also <i>beach break</i> (a surfing term), <i>beach hut, beach inspector, *beach mat, *beach robe, beachworm</i> <i>*surf beach</i> - in NZPOD - and <i>*ocean beach</i>. As well I have seen <i>beach music, *beach picnic</i> and <i>beach volleyball</i> recently in overseas publications. [*Known to me as in NZ use or former use also]. <i>Beachfront</i> is tagged in OED as chiefly US, and all citations refer to places outside the UK. It has long been used in NZ. NZ citations?

Quote: Generally the greater portion of the sand is removed, but in favourable spots, sheltered either by a slight indentation in the coast-line, or by some large pieces of drifted timber, its heavier particles remain; these consist [529] of black iron-sand (both magnetic and titaniferous oxide of iron) associated with small garnets and with gold. These black layers are often one or two inches thick, and repose upon coarse quartzose sands. As soon as a storm has subsided, the `beachers' or `surfers' as they are called, examine the coastline near their houses. When they come upon one of the rich spots, the fine particles of gold being often visible to the naked eye, they at once remove the black layer of sand out of the reach of the tide, and wash it when convenient.

If this is an unexaggerated statement, it is a very distressing one to reflect on. Since Dr. -- visited this settlement, one of the residents, Mr. --, an educated man, has opened a school for half-bred or any other children, and the progress which the children have already made is very encouraging.

If the cargo is intended for the European or American market, the skins are removed from the animal with an inch of blubber adhering, and in the final simple treatment are washed, heavily slated, and then folded or `booked' into rectangular shape for packing. Skins destined for China, however, are treated with more preliminary care. They are taken as cleanly as possible, and after careful washing are sent to the `beamer' to be thoroughly scraped free of the last remaining particles of flesh and blubber.

At one time a couple of rotating balls were considered sufficient for the amount of crushing required; now, the general practice is to have a loose ball as well as a stationary one attached to a chain, and it is called a drag ball; this drag does more work than a loose ball ... for the drag grinds the bowl as much as the tailings.

Ramson: common in Aust., also a trade name; nf W3.] Tea made in a billy over a fire, tea made by tossing a handful of tea-leaves into a billy of water on <i>the boil (used often with the epithet</i> black,<i> either defining</i> tea from the strength of the tea made judged by its colour); or <i>billy</i> from its open-fire blackened appearance: cf [1864 Apr 16 Otago Witness in 1976 Veitch Clyde on the Dunstan 29-30 Heavily swagged diggers and laden horses whose swags consist of all the household goods of a mining party, from the black billy which boils the tea, to the tom cat which kills the rats and mice.]

Quote: On the Hollyford job the road went through beech-forest, but this was locally called birch. Woe betide us if we referred to birch trees in our correspondence with Head Office: we were reminded that it was <i>beech</i> and given all sorts of advice telling us that the botanical name was something like <i>Fagus fagusti</i>, and so on. Some people are allergic to beech trees and the local name for this allergic condition was birch itch. On one occasion a compensatory claim was sent to Wellington advising that the condition suffered was birch itch. Back came a reprimand about this use of the term birch - it should be <i>beech</i>, Head Office pointed out. Nothing was done about this until one day it came to the notice of our chief. He was quick to reply and acknowledge that the trees were beech, not birch, but the itch suffered by the men was birch itch not beech itch. It was locally named by them, and as far as his staff were concerned they used the term birch itch to describe the allergy caused by beech trees. There was no further comment from the Moguls in Head Office.

They are all really beeches and the newspapers and forestry people are trying to get them so called, but up country they are still always called birches. Birch (creeks, hill, etc.) is one of the commonest components of local names in the South Island.

In the Wellington and Marlborough districts it is called `black-birch'; in Canterbury it is called `black-birch,' `white-birch,' `red-birch,' and `brown-birch'; in Otago it is known as `white-birch,' `black-birch,' or black-heart birch.' Young specimens of this tree that have no dark heart-wood are often called `white-birch.' This tree is a beech, and it would do away with confusion if it was called `black-beech'. <i>Fagus Menziesii. </i>- The commonest name of this tree is `silver-birch,' but it is often called `brown-birch,' `red-birch,' and `white-birch' [308] in different localities. It would be best to call it `silver-beech,'though it is gaining an Australasian reputation as `Southland beech.' <i>Fagus fusca. </i>- In Auckland this tree is called `black-birch'; in Wellington `red-birch'; in Nelson, Marlborough and Westland it is called `brown-birch'; and in Otago it is called both `red-birch' and `bull-birch.'

Myrsine Urvillei [ ] was known as `red birch', and Carpodetus serratus [ ] and Quintinia serrata [ ] as `white birch.' It was principally to the trees of the species Nothofagus (then known a Fagus), that the term `birch' was applied, and a distinguishing of the various kinds by the prefixing of a descriptive word was a step in the right direction; but in this instance the step was on a path that led to a quagmire. To take only the instance of N. Solandri (formerly Fagus Solandri). [v. 1885 Kirk] ... The confusion created has been endless ; it has at times even resulted in commercial loss ; [v. (Morris) 1889 Kirk `Forest Flora of NZ p.91] yet so strong is habit that confusion was preferred before a change of name. And, indeed, the bushmen might well ask what name they should adopt ; for the scientists came and added to the confusion by pointing out that the trees usually called `birch' were not birch at all, but `beech' - when a fresh crop of names resulted.: `black beech', `red beech', `dusky beech', etc. The scientists themselves, however, in calling the species Nothofagus, `beech', took care - that is, usually took care - to make the distinguishing prefix one that would not lead to a repetition of the old confusion. N. Solanderi was accordingly called `entire-leaved beech' ; N. Cliffortioides, `mountain beech' ; N. Menziesii, `round-leaved beech' ; N. fusca `tooth-leaved beech'. It was some time before even these names were agreed upon ; and `silver beech' finally took the place of `round-leaved beech' for N. Menziesii. A note may here be made of the fact that, whilst the entire-leaved beech was Fagus Solandri, on Fagus being changed to Nothofagus, Solandri was altered to Solanderi ; but this has been altered back again to Solandri ; for that was the original and not incorrect spelling of the word.

Quote: ... it is perhaps futile to hope that the more exact name [beech] will become popular ; but we might at least expect some consistent nomenclature to be adopted through the islands. At present the various species are designated almost indifferently, white, red, black, silver birch etc. What is white birch in one part of the country may be black in another ... The use of the name <i>birch</i> in place of <i>beech</i> is inexcusable, though ... N. Menziesii ... [shows] some external resemblance to the English birch.

Quote: Colour Coding [heading] ... St Patrick's Day sports organiser, Mr Lyn Thompson yesterday inquired about the difference between red, black and brown birch. It was `clearly' explained for him by a prominent axeman, Mr Bill Evans. The bark of the red birch is silver, but the timber is pink when it's green. Brown birch often has black bark, but the green timber is red. Sometimes the bark of the black birch is white, but the timber is yellow and sometimes it's brown when it's green.

Quote: On the Hollyford job the road went through beech-forest, but this was locally called birch. Woe betide us if we referred to birch trees in our correspondence with Head Office: we were reminded that it was <i>beech</i> and given all sorts of advice telling us that the botanical name was something like <i>Fagus fagusti,</i> and so on. Some people are allergic to beech trees and the local name for this allergic condition was birch itch. On one occasion a compensatory claim was sent to Wellington advising that the condition suffered was birch itch. Back came a reprimand about this use of the term birch - it should be <i>beech</i>, Head Office pointed out. Nothing was done about this until one day it came to the notice of our chief. He was quick to reply and acknowledge that the trees were beech, not birch, but the itch suffered by the men was birch itch not beech itch. It was locally named by them, and as far as his staff were concerned they used the term birch itch to describe the allergy caused by beech trees.

Quote: as common in NZ in a variety of senses and uses as it is in gen.

These and other uses are attested in OED(S) and EDD; cf hang of a; collocations (A) BIT OF (A) [to go to file 3BI5 BIT 1.]. The expression is in constant use. It has different meanings, but each is clear from the circumstances of the conversation. For example: <i>A bit of luck, A bit of a break</i> The event is praised, its quality is genuine. <i>A bit of a lark, A bit of fun</i> There is no intense quality in the event. <i>A bit of an ass, aren't you?</i> The quality of the topic is weakened so that the remark will not sting as much. <i>A bit of a hold-up (i.e. check to progress)</i> The delay is brief. <i>A bit of risk attached to it</i> The proportion of risk is not great, possibly slight. <i>A bit of a muddler, A bit of a no-hoper, A bit of a poor show </i> The quality referred to is present in full force.

It is not so easy to see why any difficulty should have occured in the identification of this fine timber-tree apart from the misleading tendency of the common names generally applied. The thin yet firm texture of the leaf, the prominent veins, the sharply-toothed margins, are characters that can only be confused with those afforded by a careless observer. Yet merely owing to the use of common names based upon colour, and applied or rather misapplied to the leaves, bark, or wood at the fancy of the bushman, no species has been more misunderstood.

Quote: <i>pi[i]wakawaka</i>, a bird (Rhipidura flabellifera), pied fantail: the so-called black fantail, which is chocolate-colour (R. fuliginosa) is ti[i]wakawaka. The former is common throughout Newzealand; the latter is common in the South Island but rather rare in the North and is thought to be a mutant of the former. Both names were applied to both birds by the Maori, but for distinction pi[i]wakawaka for the pied and ti[i]wakawaka for the black have been adopted by the Pakeha. The bird is noted for the disaster it caused to Maui in his struggle with the mother of night, Hine-nui-te-po, Death personified.

Quote: Better or not the officially sanctioned substitute was announced early in August and the Gal Blacks of brief notoriety (along with other canvassed names such as Elle Blacks and She Bs - after ABs) were finally history. The team was henceforth to be known as the Black Ferns. Here the colour adjective fittingly remains, and the noun echoes the name sported (since the early 1990s) by another black-clad international New Zealand women's team, the netballers or Silver Ferns. Since that title itself derives from the famous fernleaf-cum-national symbol of the All Black jersey (to wear the silver fern is a common variant of to be an All Black), there is an obvious appropriateness in reapplying the fern to the rugby union context. Black Ferns is further legitimised bv the presence in the natural world of a black (tree-) fern, in Maori the mamaku.

Quote: Generally the greater portion of the sand is removed, but in favourable spots, sheltered either by a slight indentation in the coast-line, or by some large pieces of drifted timber, its heavier particles remain; these consist [529] of black iron-sand (both magnetic and titaniferous oxide of iron) associated with small garnets and with gold. These black layers are often one or two inches thick, and repose upon coarse quartzose sands. As soon as a storm has subsided, the `beachers' or `surfers' as they are called, examine the coastline near their houses. When they come upon one of the rich spots, the fine particles of gold being often visible to the naked eye, they at once remove the black layer of sand out of the reach of the tide, and wash it when convenient.

Quote: The utmost confusion prevails among the common names of the birches. There are scarcely two districts, a few miles apart, in which the same name is applied to the same tree, and a similar result may be obtained by consulting two bushmen in the same bush. With a view to obviating this difficulty Mr Kirk suggests `the adoption of new names based of the obvious characteristics of foliage [e.g.] for Fagus fusca `tooth-leaved beech'; for Fagus solandri `entire-leaved beech' etc. [This is unsuitable as foliage varies] I would suggest the retention of the common Otago names Fagus fusca - Red birch ; F. solandri - Black-heart birch ; F Menziesii - Silver birch.

Quote: During its five-year run in the 1970s, Blerta attracted such an extraordinary collection of movers, shakers and far-out characters, Bruno was just one wild man among many... "It's possible to trace the beginings of the New Zealand film industry from Blerta," says Murphy, whose documentary <i>Blerta Revisited</i>, features in the naton's film festivbals this month... Blerta began in October, 1971, when Bruno was 30 years old and restless as a bear stung by a swarm of bees... Blerta was an acronym for Bruno Lawrence's Electric Revelation and Travelling Apparition... "Blurter" was also a rude term for genitals in '70s slang.

Quote: <i> blind-stabbing</i>: Used by Jack Sweeney, prospector, to describe traditional method of getting gold-bearing wash out of glacial rivers. The prospector is anchored by a rope which is controlled by a mate on the bank. He wheels a wheelbarrow as far into the torrent as is possible, shovels the alluvial wash into it blindly, because the water contains glacial silts and is milky white, and returns to the bank with as much as he can shift. This is processed at leisure for gold

Quote: A few years ago I travelled to Britain via Australia and on the boat an Englishman was telling me that while in Australia he bought a block of land and built his own house. To me the word block suggested a large piece of land, so with visions of Sid Kidman I asked him how big. He replied, `Oh, just fifth of an acre,' I said that in NZ we would call that a section. An American put in that in his country a section was a square mile and the word was used with that meaning in parts of Australia, but in the States they used the word `lot' to describe a building block. I replied that in NZ building blocks were the piles that a house stood on and the Englishman said that in Australia they called them stumps.

Quote: Marbles had a language of its own. There were names for the marbles, the games, and all the various aspects of the play. There were terms for marbles such as `taw' or `shooter', referring to the marbles used to fire with; `dubs', `dates', `stakes', `dukes', or `changers', referring to the marbles put down to be fired at. Then there were the terms referring to particular kinds of marbles: for example, agates, aggies, aggotties, American alleys, blood alleys, bomb-squashers, bonies, bonsers, bottlies, bull's eyes, bum-squashers, cat's eyes, chinkies, connies, duckies, eggies, glassies, Greeks, milkies, molly-bars, mulley-bars [mullibars: large marbles], peelies, peewees, piss-wees, pretties, Scotties, Scottish alleys, smokies, stinkies, stonies, stripies, tom-bobblers, white alleys, and in more recent years ball-bearings, chippies, plastics, and woodies. <i>Ibid.</i> 176 [Waitara, Taranaki, 1899] A `taw' was usually an `alley' or `blood alley' made of agate. We used to take them home and burn them in a fire to convert them into `blood alleys'.

Quote: [Bank clerk] `By the time I had cleaned, or `blown' the gold, it was too late to think of returning. <i>Ibid.</i> 220 The gold is placed on a flat pear-shaped metal dish, with a perpendicular rim or edge except at the point of the pear, where there is no rim. This is moved in such a manner that the gold is tossed up, and all the finer particles and dirt are worked forward towards the opening, out by which the operator blows the sand.

Quote: The sheep they shore were not so well woolled on the belly and carried less wool on the points than they do now, so that fewer short blows were required to take off the trimmings; but the shears they used were one inch and a half shorter in the blade and, being joined by a single instead of a double bow, required a wrist of iron to drive them continuously throughout a summer's day. A piece of raw hide known as a knocker is now used to prevent the shears clashing when closed, but before this was introduced the clack and snap of steel meeting steel was a noise inseparable from any busy shearing shed.

Although most of the nucleation process is kept a secret, the Eyris Blue Pearl Company are continuing to refine the art of attaching a seed to the inside of the shell, beneath the mantle, so that a blue pearl mabe can develop... Once the seed is inserted beneath the mantle, the paua begins to overlay this nucleus with its brilliant mother-of-pearl, made up of layer upon layer of conchiolin and nacre.

The origin and dating of the word are doubtful. There is a similar word poddy calf for a hand-fed calf, recorded in Australia from last century. The present New Zealand meaning seems to have arisen about 1929. The Christchurch Times, 17 August 1929, reported: `During the last year or so quite a trade has grown up in young, or `bobby' calves, which are taken in by the freezing works, killed and exported.' The term <i>vealer</i> is also used.

The trade, which is known locally as `The Bobby Calf' trade, developed during that season, and has extended rapidly each year since. Under this system of disposal, calves are collected by motor lorry and delivered at freezing-works, where they are slaughtered and packed as boneless veal.

Quote: `Boiling-down' was formerly practised to a considerable extent in Australia; the mere fat or tallow of the animal for export to England <i>being worth far more than the meat for colonial consumption</i>. `Boiling-down establishments' were formed in the pastoral districts, and the process became a regular business. The sheep or cattle were killed and skinned, the carcass thrown into the boiling vat, the fat skimmed off for export tallow, and the meat thrown away. `Boiling down' will probably remain a permanent feature of Australian grazing in the districts remote from large towns.

Notes: J Boon (jboon@unitec.ac.nz) suggests this comes from the phrase "bolt from the blue". Trish Ryan (dentrish@clear.net.nz) says it comes from "infamous horse betting circles. Back before the days of judicial videos, race results were sometimes 'pre-arranged'. The backed horse would be given the perfect run in behind a nominated pacemaker. Other horses would be ridden into deadend passages or taken wide in the run home. Occasionally an uncooperative pacemaking horse would 'bolt' on its jockey and win the race - and lose large betting plunges that had been made on the intended victor." >Google search showed in used in Australia also and to a lesser degree also UK, the Netherlands.

Boneseed is flowering now, the best time for control... Boneseed is widely established throughout the coastal areas of the Wellington region, especially Wellington's south coast, Eastbourne, Pukerua Bay and Raumati... Boneseed produces clusters of small, yellow daisy flowers that cover the plant in late winter to early summer. The single-seed is very hard and bone-like in colour and texture when ripe (thus the name boneseed. Boneseed is a bushy shrub which grows to 2-3 metres high producing up to 50,000 seeds per plant. From South Africa, it was introduced to New Zealand as an ornamental plant and is now found throughout the North Island, mostly in coastal situations, and in the South Island.

Quote: Incoming skins are sorted to arbitrary standards - wigs (old males), clap-matches (females), bulls, yearlings, grey or silver pups (under one year), black pups. If the cargo is intended for the European or American market, the skins are removed from the animal with an inch of blubber adhering, and in the final simple treatment are washed, heavily slated, and then folded or `booked' into rectangular shape for packing. Skins destined for China, however, are treated with more preliminary care. They are taken as cleanly as possible, and after careful washing are sent to the `beamer' to be thoroughly scraped free of the last remaining particles of flesh and blubber.

Quote: But the attitude of the settlers was not wholly a product of their environment. To a large extent their prejudice was imported with them. Those who had encountered few Maoris, like the Otago and Canterbury settlers, were as biassed as the rest. The Maori was called `nigger', `black', and in the <i>Auckland Examiner</i>, `Boshee' [subscript 44] by people who had never seen a slave. The word `Maori' conjured up in the settlers' minds a stereotype based on experience in other colonies. [fn44] Perhaps a mixture of `bosh' and `Quashee', a West Indian negro.

Quote: Emerging originally from children's slang to bulk quite considerably in a grown-up world is the serviceable term <i>bot</i>. Its origin seems to be medical, since in early uses <i>bot</i> is rendered as a germ, doubtless from bot-fly. [52] From this comes the phrase of greeting, <i>How are the bots biting?</i> By the 1920s a <i>bot</i> is being used extensively for a troublesome person, for a persistent borrower, a financial parasite. By 1925 the noun <i>bot</i> was translated to a verb, and as a result we have <i>to bot,</i> to borrow money, to impose on others, and <i>botting</i>, the practice. <i>To bot on</i> a person is widely used. An interesting extension to the term is to be found in Australia, in which country<i> to bite</i> is often the equivalent for <i>bot</i>. On the other hand <i>cold botting</i> is a straight-out request for food at house-doors. ... Of fairly recent development in New Zealand is the phrase<i> to have the bot</i>, to be sick or out of sorts, moody or disagreeable. par

Quote: Marbles had a language of its own. There were names for the marbles, the games, and all the various aspects of the play. There were terms for marbles such as `taw' or `shooter', referring to the marbles used to fire with; `dubs', `dates', `stakes', `dukes', or `changers', referring to the marbles put down to be fired at. Then there were the terms referring to particular kinds of marbles: for example, agates, aggies, aggotties, American alleys, blood alleys, bomb-squashers, bonies, bonsers, bottlies, bull's eyes, bum-squashers, cat's eyes, chinkies, connies, duckies, eggies, glassies, Greeks, milkies, molly-bars, mulley-bars [mullibars: large marbles], peelies, peewees, piss-wees, pretties, Scotties, Scottish alleys, smokies, stinkies, stonies, stripies, tom-bobblers, white alleys, and in more recent years ball-bearings, chippies, plastics, and woodies. ...When I first went to school, bottlies were good currency, being classed as two-ers, but usually sodawaters and black-bottlies counted as the equivalent of six-ers. ...

Quote: Another New Zealand expression is `Up the Bouai' (pronounced boo-eye). There was a place near Auckland city which many years ago was somewhat isolated, and it was called the Bouai. The word is not Maori, for there is no `b' and no `h' sound in the original Maori tongue. Once more I cannot tell you where the word came from, but to go `up the Bouai' has become fairly general in use. Today, if a person comes to town from any lonely place in the forests or mountains, and a friend asks him where he has been, most likely the answer will be, `Oh, I've been up the Bouai.' It is a general word for an isolated region.

Quote: Boundary keeper A shepherd who keeps sheep from passing an unfenced boundary. He goes along the boundary once or twice a day or, if he has a convenient lookout, watches the sheep all day. In the old days any boundary keepers lived on their boundaries all the year and never saw anyone, except at mustering or by chance. The Australian word `boundary rider' has never been used in New Zealand; in fact, a boundary rider's work is different. He looks after the fences and sheep in a large paddock. (C.)

Quote: `A BOX OF BIRDS' Sir, - I am aware that idioms in any language are often difficult to analyse, but there is one phrase used in New Zealand which leaves me completely puzzled. It is the expression `a box of birds,' given in reply to the greeting `How are you?' and is evidently intended to mean a state of well-being. This appears to be so completely irrelevant that I would be pleased if any of your readers could elucidate, if that is possible. The term suggests to me something to be prepared for the dinner table, but I am willing to be corrected. - I am, etc. KIWIPOM. ? 1957 Evening Post (?p) [To feel like a `box of birds' is to feel happy and chirpy - Ed.]

Quote: <i>BOX OF BIRDS</i>: After hearing this from another New Zealander, I tried out the phrase on many people in the South of England and London. Not one person had heard of it, and most were unable, from first hearing (in context), to judge its actual meaning or inference.

Definition: ca1945 As a totalisator or betting convenience, to pair horses in certain circumstances so that if either is placed a dividend is paid on both. The circumstances are these: a) horses beyond 18 in any race are paired (bracketted) with a number, and hence a horse, already given (e.g. in a race of 20 entries, the last numbers would be 17, 17a, 18, 18a); b) similarly, when entries are more than can be safely run at one time and the race must be run in two divisions, each horse in the first division is paired (bracketted) with each horse in the second; c) (formerly) horses of the same ownership (galloping) or of the same ownership and trainership (trotting and pacing), running in the same race were bracketted.

Quote: Mr. Andrew Liddell, who lived to be over a hundred, and who was a bullock-driver from the age of sixteen until he was twenty-two, had much to tell me of this adventurous portion of his long career, ... `You ask how the bullocks were attached to the vehicle, and as bullock-driving is now a lost art, I had better try and explain ... Very seldom was harness used, and then without winkers, and it was called branks. The pulling strain came on the bows, and a yoke joined two bows and went over each neck of a pair of bullocks. If there were five pairs, say, a chain ran from the yoke of the first pair to the yoke of the second pair, and another chain from the second to the third, and another chain from the third to the fourth. These chains were lighter between the first pairs and heavier as you got further back. The two rear bullocks were yoked to the pole of the dray or waggon. As there were no reins, the driving was all by commands and cracking the whip. The calls were `Get up' or `Gee up' to start, `Whoa' to stop, `Come here' to turn to left, and `Gee off' to turn right. If you came to a sharp corner, you would often say persuasively, `Way! Way! Come here.'' There is a general impression that bullocks could not be successfully driven without roaring oaths and curses at them, but this idea is a relic of early-day humour.

Quote: Late last year, the other members of English's brat pack - Roger Sowry, Nick Smith and Tony Ryall - began pushing for the removal of Wyatt Creech from the deputy prime ministership... But English, like others in the so-called Shipley "brat pack", is conscious the government can deliver real benefits only if there is longterm growth in the economy.

Quote: Tony Ryall, the only member of National's "brat pack" not to be made a minister, is settling in for a regime of passive-aggression in his chairmanship of the finance and expenditure committee. <i>Ibid.</i> 34 Socially, English remains bonded to National's erstwhile "brat pack" - himself, Smith, Sowry and Tony Ryall - who once presented themselves as an update of Labour's fish'n'chip gang by posing for a publicity short while supposedly plotting at McDonald's.

Quote: "The brat pack was wetting its nappies," observes one seasoned minister caustically, referring to the quartet of up and coming ministers led by Bill English... Instead, it is the brat pack who, along with Shipley, are intended to be National's energetic, new public face. English in Finance, Nick Smith in Education, Tony Ryall in Justice and Sowry in Social Services are attempting to make the running by a series of announcements in their portfolios.

Quote: BUCKJUMPING [title] ... August 23, 1856. I mounted my good mare `Lassie,' with the intention of leading the two packed horses, when to my astonishment her ladyship started buckjumping, and after a long fight, finding she could not throw me, suddenly stood on her hind legs and fell over backwards. ... Buckjumping is a horrid vice, although it is a very amusing performance - to the spectator. The horse tries to roll itself up into a ball, with all four feet close together, head down as near the ground as possible between the forelegs, tail well down, back stuck up like the hump of a camel when in good condition. Attitude is everything. Then commences the performance. With an active spring and rather a forward motion up you go in the air, and down again with a jerk, then up and down like an india-rubber ball, occasionally varying the action by jumping forward and kicking out behind with both legs at once, returning to the oval position as rapidly as possible, then turning round like a teetotum at lightning speed.

Quote: <i>Buckley's chance.</i>-A correspondent from Kirwee, the same as explained <i>Jimmy Woodser</i> for me, writes that Buckley was one of the earliest convicts (perhaps the first) to escape from Botany Bay and take to the bush. It was then thought impossible to do this and live, as apart from the problem of food and water, the blacks were numerous and savage and reported to be cannibals. Extensive search was made, but no trace was found of Buckley; and it was concluded that the natives had got him. Any other convict who talked of escaping was invariably told that he would have `Buckley's chance' - hence the saying. However, many years afterwards Buckley was found to be still living. He had managed to make friends with a small band of natives who were moving to a remote part of the country, married one of their gins, and lived their life. The convict system had by that time been abolished, so the Government granted him a free pardon.

## "bulkie"


WordClass: noun

Definition: shortened form of "bulk tonnage operator"



Domain: [none]

Region: [none]


Notes: King (24/3/1999) says bulk tonnage operators were firms which developed from the 1960 in reaction to the then regulations limiting road competition with rail. These firms consolidated small lots of goods into wagon lot, thus creating "bulk" goods (from the Railways perspective) out of much smaller units. Their workers did not in fact "load bulk goods" - it was the result of their working that the goods became "bulk". Such firms still exist; their current formal name is "freight forwarders" although one hears bulk tonnage operatore or "BTO" occasionally. Examples include Mainfreight and Daily Freight... Given that the expanded name of "bulk tonnage operator" is some thirty years older than [your] example, I would be surprised if its contraction is not also somewhere recorded earlier than 1991.

Red Birch of Wellington, Nelson, and in part of Otago and Southland. It is not so easy to see why any difficulty should have occured in the identification of this fine timber-tree apart from the misleading tendency of the common names generally applied. The thin yet firm texture of the leaf, the prominent veins, the sharply-toothed margins, are characters that can only be confused with those afforded by a careless observer. Yet merely owing to the use of common names based upon colour, and applied or rather misapplied to the leaves, bark, or wood at the fancy of the bushman, no species has been more misunderstood.

Quote: If the English sailors have acquired a not undeserved reputation for their curses, surely the New Zealand bullock-drivers must be reckoned superior to them in this accomplishment, for such an assortment of fantastic oaths from all kingdoms of Nature, Heaven and Hell I have never heard before from mortal lips. Astounded I listened to this blue-eyed son of Albion and was at last impelled to ask him why he cursed so horribly; it could serve no purpose and only made the beast more stubborn. `You don't understand, Sir,' the young man answered. `I'm only speaking the bullock language. The animal certainly wouldn't understand or obey me if I spoke to him as I would to my horse. The bullock has been brought up to carry in this way, and if I want to get on fast, I've got to talk to him like this.' To this argument advanced by the driver with a good-natured smile I naturally could find no reply. I refer it to the linguists to enrol this new language in the appropriate family of dialects.

Quote: In its simplest form bullrush involved one person standing in the middle of the field, then everyone else lined up on one side. The middle person would call someone's name (often in a rhyming way) into the middle. The object being of course to get past the middle to the other end of the field. If the runner was caught he or she joined the middle to call and catch more runners. Should a single runner get through there would be a bullrush, where everyone ran through the middle... These games had a thousand different names in earlier times: broken barley, king dick, punch king (where you had to punch the runner down!), goosey and so on... An excellent variation was.. cockarusha, in which everyone, instead of running, tries to hop through the middle.

Quote: Is there one single New Zealamnder who has not played bullrush in some form or other?... There are variations. The main one is the classic 'bar the door' (which for some phonetically evolved into 'barbador'), where the main difference is that runners line up at both ends of the field. These games had a thousand names in earlier days: broken barley, king dick, punch king (where you had to punch the runner down), goosey and so on... Kerikeri school banned it (they called it king asini) three years ago.

The bully family is called Gobiidae by some writers, Eleotridae by others.

Notes: Philip Temple e-mailed on 2/7/2000 that "On 12 March 1843 in Nelson, Te Rangihaeata told Arthur Wakefield that he would 'bung-a-bung' him if he went to the Wairau... In the DNZE p. 103 you deal with the word 'bung' which can mean become useless, broken, ruined and 'bung out' meaning to die. But your earliest reference for these words is 1887 and the origin is given as Australian pidgin. I wonder what the earliest Australian reference is and whether Rangihaeata would have picked it up from this source so early. It seems that if he was using it, then it already had some currency in NZ by then." Harry Orsman replied that "I think (and I can recall this from the limits of an imperfect memory) that this use in early Maori-Pakeha New Zealand relations was a pidgin word from 'bang(a)bang' meaning to shoot. It wasn't related to the Aboriginal word usually spelled 'bung' 'dead', etc."

Quote: The Lyttelton waterfront has been working under the bureau system of engaging labour for nine years now. ... `And,' the bureau manager said, `the men wouldn't like to go back to the old way again.' Under the old system, foremen of the various shipping companies stood on a small platform or block with the men awaiting employment before them and nominated those they required to work their own ships. The trouble with this `auction block' system, as it was called, was that each company tended to give preference to a certain group of men. It engaged the same men first all the time and employed others only when the preferred group were all at work. This meant very often the available work on the waterfront was not evenly shared; and that's what the bureau system tries to avoid.

## "burn"


WordClass: noun

Definition: (an instance of) clearing bush, scrub, unpalatable grass, etc. from the land by means of fire to improve pasture or to bring into cultivation by clearing logs or bush. (There seems a distict cleavage between early South Island and early NI usage, cf. burn v1. In the South Island `a burn' was a periodical burning off of old tussock to prepare the way for good crop of new grass. In 20th century usage, however, has been applied (e.g. in the Pelorus Sounds) to burning off noxious weeds, fern, scrub etc. to get a good growth of green feed (cf. match-farming). In the North Island, `a burn' was chiefly applied to clearing away (felled) bush by burning, a burning off (or over) of unwanted bush: that is, to clearing or bringing land into cultivation, not merely to improving pasture. burn off seems chiefly used in this North Island sense (cf bush-burning))

Definition: From the 1930s at least, according to W. Martin and Bob Adams of NZ Seamen's Union, a bad discharge from a ship, a transferred and figurative usage from stoking the furnace of a coal-burning ship. An inefficient or tyro stoker who built a bad fire had a `burn-out' in the furnace - i.e. the fire went partially out. He was allowed to get away with one of these, but on doing a second, was eased off the ship. Hence it came to mean a bad discharge in general.

Quote: [Hdg] "Tauranga" or "Bush Disease". This peculiar wasting disease, which is confined to the tract of land lying in the vicinity of Tauranga, and extending from there to Rotorua and Lichfield, was made the subject of an investigation by Mr. Park three years ago... It appears that both sheep and cattle will do well and put on condition for the first few months after being placed on this diseased country, but as time goes on a gradual wasting sets in, which ends in death if they are not removed to another district.

Quote: Bush jiggers were the motor-driven creations used to transport humans along bush trams... Small hand-worked jiggers were used extensively on the NZR but they were not common on trams... The first bush jiggers were constructed early in the 20th century... The earliest confirmed jigger appeared in April 1908 when it was reported that a trolley had been built by Gamman at Te Ohu to convey 10-12 men to and from work... The principal use of bush jiggers was to get the bushmen to and from work. Compared to other options they were faster, safer,warmer, and drier. <i>Ibid.</i> 58 The development of the bush jigger spelled the end for most bush camps because they made it possible to travel to work over long distances in comparative speed and comfort.

Quote: The way in which the bush people - the bushmen and their wives - stuck to one another is shown by the way they rallied round in the case of a family that was in need. A common method of raising money was called a `basket social'. A hall would be used for the function, and the people of the district would be invited to bring along baskets. Now these baskets were made of any material at all at hand, and it was remarkable the ingenuity and workmanship shown in making them. ... In the basket its maker put a supper, the food cooked at home ... [151] Now on the night of the basket social, all the baskets would be handed in ... They would then be auctioned, and the purchaser of the basket would have the pleasure and the honour of having supper with the provider of the basket. ... Now I've seen them pay twelve ... pounds in those days for a basket, just to make sure that the girl of the boy's choice saw that he really meant business. ... Every penny of that would go to the family in need ...

Whether one uses bush-line or snow-line depends upon the locality of the speaker, or the point of view of the speaker, e.g. a bushman would be more likely to speak of the bush-line, a mountaineer of the snow-line. bush-line and snow-line are only occas. synonymous. e.g. in mountain-country, in the summer, when snow is lying high or has disappeared, the bush-line stands out clearly, but is often called (locally and colloquially) `the snow-line': (cf. also scrub-line).

Usually he would sit down and sharpen his axe for a minute or two then carry on chopping, the feeling slowly fading away in about half an hour. Among ourselves, to give this affliction an important sounding name, we always called it "Hydrophobia" but it is more generally called "Bushman's staggers," and is supposed to be caused by overworking the stomach at the same time as overworking the muscles.

Quote: In the nineteenth century the ring game seems to have been the most popular marble game. (In more recent years marble games with holes have had the greater role.) There was Big Ring, in which a circle a yard or more in diameter was drawn on the ground; there was the mullibar variation, in which an outsize taw was catapulted amongst the marbles in this circle. There were Little Ring, Liney, Follows, Follow the Taw, Holey, and then, on a less important scale, Butcher's Board, in which the marbles were bowled through the holes in a board, Eye-Drop, Knock-Backs, Leggings-Out (or Leggin's-Out), Span-'Em, and Backits. The last was more usually a girls' game.

Quote: GREENBONE, BUTTERFISH, KELP SALMON, or KELPIE (MARARI) <i>Coridodax pullus</i> (Bloch and Schneider) ... The name Greenbone is given on account of the bones being a bright green colour, which is so permanent as to with-stand boiling or bleaching. ... The name kelp-fish is given on account of its habit of feeding on kelp or seaweed, and also because it likes to make its home among kelp. In such a habitat it has both food and a favourite home. Kelp-salmon is given for two reasons. The first part, kelp, is explained in the last paragraph, while the second half, salmon, is because the fish is not unlike a Salmon in shape, so much so that new chums who caught this fish have been under the impression they had caught the protected introduced Salmon, but of that later in this chapter. But why this dark coloured fish should receive the name Butterfish I am unable to say. It is certainly not as some people suggest because it needs butter with it when cooked or eaten. In Auckland the fish known to South Islanders as Spotty (<i>Pseudolabrus celidotus</i>) is called Butterfish on account of its bright golden colouring on the lower parts of the body and fins fancifully resembling the colour of butter. The name Kelpie, of course, is derived from its habit of living amidst kelp and it is easily understood how the `ie' was tacked on by fishermen.

Quote: The Butterfish is very similar in form, and is related to, the Kelpfish (<i>Odax vittatus</i>), which is also a brightly-coloured species and found in similar situations, feeding on kelp and other marine plants in rocky localities. <i>Ibid.</i> 130 It is unfortunate that the Butterfish has been given a variety of local names which have originated either from their habit of associating with kelp, their body form, or from the colour of their bones, as for example, Kelpfish, Kelp-salmon, Greenbone, and several other names not so easy to explain. Butterfish or Greenbone are possibly the more generally used names for this fish but it should be remembered that in the North Island the Spotty (<i>Pseudolabrus celidotus</i>), a very different fish, is related to the Butterfish there is superficially little resemblance between the two species. <i>Ibid.</i> 169 Butterfish Coridodax pullus Greenbone; Kelp Salmon; Kelpi; Kelpfish

Quote: Most of our cities and even small towns have restaurants that offer and wine service and / or allow patrons to bring their own wine. Not many diners know that the BYO concept originated in Australia and New Zealand during the 1960s and 70s and is rarely found elsewhere. The antipodean origin is acknowledged in the authoritative Oxford Companion to Wine.

Quote: We stopped BYO for larger groups two years ago. All they were interested in doing was bringing in a couple of cases of booze and having a party at our expense... You want BYO, he says, then you go to a restaurant, probably an ethnic restaurant or cafe, where you get good cheap food that doesn't take a great deal of preparation and few staff. That's the sort of restaurant that can afford to do BYO.

Quote: I don't want to buy into a punch-up over the BYO syndrome, but this tell-tale brown-bag routine is something I shy away from. It's pretty much an Australian and New Zealand thing to ferry our own drinkies into restaurants, sometimes even transporting them in a designer bag, suitably labelled, and drawing attention to the fact that l'il ole me is bringing my own.

Quote: Inside, on the walls, are black and white photographs of early Plimmerton, and the cafe is one of the last of a species fast facing extinction in central Wellington - the BYO restaurant. Twenty-five years ago, "BYO restaurant" had exciting, avant-garde connotations of a new breed of restauranteur, intent on providing a hip, casual alternative to the handful of stiff, expensive, fully licensed fine dining restaurants which, aspart from hotels and a scattering of tired old steak and chip grill-roomns, previously comprised the sum total of the New Zealand dining-out experience.
