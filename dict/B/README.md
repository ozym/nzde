>  <b>OWEN & PERKINS</b> (Joe Gasparich, Northland kauri country), The way in which the bush people - the bushmen and their wives - stuck to one another is shown by the way they rallied round in the case of a family that was in need. A common method of raising money was called a `basket social'. A hall would be used for the function, and the people of the district would be invited to bring along baskets. Now these baskets were made of any material at all at hand, and it was remarkable the ingenuity and workmanship shown in making them. ... In the basket its maker put a supper, the food cooked at home ... [151] Now on the night of the basket social, all the baskets would be handed in ... They would then be auctioned, and the purchaser of the basket would have the pleasure and the honour of having supper with the provider of the basket. ... Now I've seen them pay twelve ... pounds in those days for a basket, just to make sure that the girl of the boy's choice saw that he really meant business. ... Every penny of that would go to the family in need ... (1986 -- ,Speaking for Ourselves,150)

>  <b>BATISTICH</b> Basket socials were always a stir [in Northland c1920s]. ... Basket socials were the nearest we got to bacchanalia - tipsy cake in large doses could have strangely affecting results.

Each girl would make a pretty basket and fill it with good things for supper. When supper-time came, the baskets were auctioned from the stage and keen was the rivalry and competition for some of the baskets, young blades emptying their pockets and often dipping into their bank accounts in trying to out-bid their rivals.

>  <b>PYKE</b> The Dunstan gold workings were of two kinds - technically known as `beach claims' and `bank claims'. The latter were on the gravelly river banks which the miners sluiced away bodily for the golden grains ... The former were on the sandy margins of the river, and were often extended by means of `wing-dams' and other ingenious devices far into the rushing waters. In these claims the gold was found lodged in `pockets' or fissures formed by the slate bars ... (1873 -- ,Wild Will Enderby,Bk I iv 17)

>  <b>MAY</b> Collet's quicksilver plates rapidly became common on the beach-claims although they did not completely supplant the simpler cradle and sluice-box. <i>Ibid.</i> 244 It was a matter of nice judgement. The digger recognized four classes of payable ground: `tucker ground' kept him in food with nothing to spare; a `wages claim' gave him a pound or two above living expenses; a `riser' was a rich claim; and a `piler' or `homeward bounder' the richest of all. Probably most of the `pilers' were beach-claims, where the leads were shallow and rich, the outlay small and provisions cheap because of easy access. (1967 -- ,West Coast Gold Rushes,170,1962 ed.)

## binning
 
 <i>n.</i> broker service for the disposal of small or mixed lots of wool in which each grower's wool is classed and weighed to bins with similar types from other growers, cf bin.

>  The wool removed by crutching is of low value and the amount per clip is usually small. For these reasons `crutchings' are seldom if ever classed except by the wool brokers when the wool is sent to them for binning. <i>Ibid.</i> 711 In `Binning,' the bales are broken up and classed into lines. This method of building up saleable lines is generally used in the case of small parcels of fleece wool and bales of oddments which cannot be included in the main lines without destroying their evenness. As each vendor's wool [712] is classed in the binning-room, the wool in each class is weighed and credited to the owner before being placed in its appropriate bin.

## birch
 
 <i>n.</i> (any of a group of deciduous, Northern Hemisphere trees with slender branches and smooth bark, used for timber.) In NZ commonly, but incorrectly, applied to the native beech spp.; a common popular name c1795-1970s for the trees and timber of <i>Nothofagus</i> spp., preferred common name beech q.v. Also occas. used for species of other general thought to resemble Nothofagus. occas. (usu. overseas usage) New Zealand birch. As with beech, vernacular naming tries to distinguish var. and spp. by ref. to colour of bark, texture of wood or timber, appearance of leaf, etc., but with similar confusion and local variation. [cf the use of birch by Cook of Nothofagus in Tierra del Fuego (=? beech <i>Nothofagus antarctica</i> or <i>N. pumilio</i> or both [fn]) 1769 January 25 Cook's Journals (1955) 1/51 [Tierra del Fuego] <i>`The wood is of the Birch kind... wild celery' [fn3</i>Apium <i>graveolens</i>].]

>  <b>ANDERSON</b> On the Hollyford job the road went through beech-forest, but this was locally called birch. Woe betide us if we referred to birch trees in our correspondence with Head Office: we were reminded that it was <i>beech</i> and given all sorts of advice telling us that the botanical name was something like <i>Fagus fagusti</i>, and so on. Some people are allergic to beech trees and the local name for this allergic condition was birch itch. On one occasion a compensatory claim was sent to Wellington advising that the condition suffered was birch itch. Back came a reprimand about this use of the term birch - it should be <i>beech</i>, Head Office pointed out. Nothing was done about this until one day it came to the notice of our chief. He was quick to reply and acknowledge that the trees were beech, not birch, but the itch suffered by the men was birch itch not beech itch. It was locally named by them, and as far as his staff were concerned they used the term birch itch to describe the allergy caused by beech trees. There was no further comment from the Moguls in Head Office. (1975 -- ,Men of the Milford Road,93) [NOTES: (Griffiths Collection)]

>  <i>Birch</i>. Various species of Nothofagus. There are various kinds (white, red, black etc.) of trees in New Zealand called birches. They are all really beeches and the newspapers and forestry people are trying to get them so called, but up country they are still always called birches. Birch (creeks, hill, etc.) is one of the commonest components of local names in the South Island. ([1898 Morris Austral-English], and an unpublished letter to Hunter Brown from Dr Hodgkinson, August 9, 1854.) (Sep 16, 1933 -- ,Press, The,15) [NOTES: Acland Glossary]



 
 <i>n.</i>

>  <i>Fagus Solandri.</i> - The most common name of this tree is `black-birch,' but it has several other names. In the Wellington and Marlborough districts it is called `black-birch'; in Canterbury it is called `black-birch,' `white-birch,' `red-birch,' and `brown-birch'; in Otago it is known as `white-birch,' `black-birch,' or black-heart birch.' Young specimens of this tree that have no dark heart-wood are often called `white-birch.' This tree is a beech, and it would do away with confusion if it was called `black-beech'. <i>Fagus Menziesii. </i>- The commonest name of this tree is `silver-birch,' but it is often called `brown-birch,' `red-birch,' and `white-birch' [308] in different localities. It would be best to call it `silver-beech,'though it is gaining an Australasian reputation as `Southland beech.' <i>Fagus fusca. </i>- In Auckland this tree is called `black-birch'; in Wellington `red-birch'; in Nelson, Marlborough and Westland it is called `brown-birch'; and in Otago it is called both `red-birch' and `bull-birch.' The most suitable name is `red-beech.' (1918 -- ,NZ Journal of Science & Technology,1/307)

>  The utmost confusion prevails among the common names of the birches. There are scarcely two districts, a few miles apart, in which the same name is applied to the same tree, and a similar result may be obtained by consulting two bushmen in the same bush. With a view to obviating this difficulty Mr Kirk suggests `the adoption of new names based of the obvious characteristics of foliage [e.g.] for Fagus fusca `tooth-leaved beech' ... (1876 -- ,TrNZI,64) [NOTES: (Blair)]

>  [this cit. not spec. repeated in individual entries] [In Oxford Forest] I learned that the tree [F. solandri, entire-leaved beech ] was termed [red, brown, white, black, and yellow] birch at different stages of its growth, but the application of these terms differed greatly; perhaps Black Birch was most generally applied to the mature condition before decay commenced, and White birch to the young state; but there were too many exceptions to allow the names to be anything but misleading. (1885 -- ,TrNZI,17/300) [NOTES: (Kirk, NZ Beeches)]

>  The perversity with which the true `beeches' have become popularly known as `birches,' and different kinds of `mapau' as `maples - a popular name which includes small trees of widely distinct Natural Order, is enough to fill with despair any botanist who desires to foster a system of popular names that will be free from misleading and inaccurate suggestions. (1891 -- ,NZ Journal of Science,1/50)

>  '... the term birch may be regarded as a generic name applied by bushmen to any small-leaved tree, and qualified by the prefixes `black', `white' or `red' at the caprice of the individual or as may be suggested by the colour of its foliage, bark or timber.' So the term `black birch' was in many districts applied to Pittosporum tenuifolium [ ] and to Weinmannia racemosa [Kamahi] in Otago - the latter tree being also known as `brown birch' or `red birch.' Myrsine Urvillei [ ] was known as `red birch', and Carpodetus serratus [ ] and Quintinia serrata [ ] as `white birch.' It was principally to the trees of the species Nothofagus (then known a Fagus), that the term `birch' was applied, and a distinguishing of the various kinds by the prefixing of a descriptive word was a step in the right direction; but in this instance the step was on a path that led to a quagmire. To take only the instance of N. Solandri (formerly Fagus Solandri). [v. 1885 Kirk] ... The confusion created has been endless ; it has at times even resulted in commercial loss ; [v. (Morris) 1889 Kirk `Forest Flora of NZ p.91] yet so strong is habit that confusion was preferred before a change of name. And, indeed, the bushmen might well ask what name they should adopt ; for the scientists came and added to the confusion by pointing out that the trees usually called `birch' were not birch at all, but `beech' - when a fresh crop of names resulted.: `black beech', `red beech', `dusky beech', etc. The scientists themselves, however, in calling the species Nothofagus, `beech', took care - that is, usually took care - to make the distinguishing prefix one that would not lead to a repetition of the old confusion. N. Solanderi was accordingly called `entire-leaved beech' ; N. Cliffortioides, `mountain beech' ; N. Menziesii, `round-leaved beech' ; N. fusca `tooth-leaved beech'. It was some time before even these names were agreed upon ; and `silver beech' finally took the place of `round-leaved beech' for N. Menziesii. A note may here be made of the fact that, whilst the entire-leaved beech was Fagus Solandri, on Fagus being changed to Nothofagus, Solandri was altered to Solanderi ; but this has been altered back again to Solandri ; for that was the original and not incorrect spelling of the word. (1926 -- ,TrNZI,56-57/663) [NOTES: Andersen Popular Names ff Kirk in 1875 [Reports on the Durability of N.Z. Timber 16]]

>  <b>LAING & BLACKWELL</b> ... it is perhaps futile to hope that the more exact name [beech] will become popular ; but we might at least expect some consistent nomenclature to be adopted through the islands. At present the various species are designated almost indifferently, white, red, black, silver birch etc. What is white birch in one part of the country may be black in another ... The use of the name <i>birch</i> in place of <i>beech</i> is inexcusable, though ... N. Menziesii ... [shows] some external resemblance to the English birch. (1940 -- ,NZ Plants,136)

>  Colour Coding [heading] ... St Patrick's Day sports organiser, Mr Lyn Thompson yesterday inquired about the difference between red, black and brown birch. It was `clearly' explained for him by a prominent axeman, Mr Bill Evans. The bark of the red birch is silver, but the timber is pink when it's green. Brown birch often has black bark, but the green timber is red. Sometimes the bark of the black birch is white, but the timber is yellow and sometimes it's brown when it's green.

>  <b>SINCLAIR</b> In 1930 J.G. Coates had called Ward's budget `the Black Budget' [PD 1931, 229, 88] - but that was long forgotten. This time the label stuck. Nordmeyer's budget [of June 1958] was remembered as `the black budget' for many years. It can be argued that it was good for `the country'. For the government it was a suicidal mistake. It was the biggest blunder in Nash's political career. Although he was not immediately and directly responsible, he was the leader and did not say `No'. (1976 -- ,Nash,309)

>  Better or not the officially sanctioned substitute was announced early in August and the Gal Blacks of brief notoriety (along with other canvassed names such as Elle Blacks and She Bs - after ABs) were finally history.

Since that title itself derives from the famous fernleaf-cum-national symbol of the All Black jersey (to wear the silver fern is a common variant of to be an All Black), there is an obvious appropriateness in reapplying the fern to the rugby union context. Black Ferns is further legitimised bv the presence in the natural world of a black (tree-) fern, in Maori the mamaku. (Jan 1999 -- ,NZWords,2(1) : 5)

As soon as a storm has subsided, the `beachers' or `surfers' as they are called, examine the coastline near their houses. When they come upon one of the rich spots, the fine particles of gold being often visible to the naked eye, they at once remove the black layer of sand out of the reach of the tide, and wash it when convenient.

>  While on an official visit to the Thames Goldfield I ...[observed] the ... effect of Cyanide of Potassium, in preventing the flouring of mercury used in working the blanketings. These blanketings I found have ... a decidedly acid reaction, due ... to the presence of ferric and ferrous salts ..., and it is to the former ... that what is commonly known as [335] `flouring,' is mainly due, in the process cited above; such ferric salts being able to either oxidize or chloridize the surface of any mercury ..., thus enfilming it with a compound, which being practically insoluble in water ... prevents that metallic contact taking place between detached mercurial globules, which is necessary to amalgamation. (1876 -- ,TrNZI,8/334) [NOTES: (Skey)]

>  The blanket tailings or blanketings, as they are otherwise called, consist mostly of iron pyrites and other sulphides, cobines with quartz, and contain a fair proportion of gold ...that had escaped over the silver tables. These tailings are treated in berdans with extra quicksilver and ground up. The berdans now in use at the Thames ... are generally five feet in diameter ... At one time a couple of rotating balls were considered sufficient for the amount of crushing required; now, the general practice is to have a loose ball as well as a stationary one attached to a chain, and it is called a drag ball; this drag does more work than a loose ball ... for the drag grinds the bowl as much as the tailings.

Practical sheep men found that this complaint produced `staggers'.

The word `Maori' conjured up in the settlers' minds a stereotype based on experience in other colonies. [fn44] Perhaps a mixture of `bosh' and `Quashee', a West Indian negro.

>  <b>BAKER</b> Emerging originally from children's slang to bulk quite considerably in a grown-up world is the serviceable term <i>bot</i>. Its origin seems to be medical, since in early uses <i>bot</i> is rendered as a germ, doubtless from bot-fly. [52] From this comes the phrase of greeting, <i>How are the bots biting?</i> By the 1920s a <i>bot</i> is being used extensively for a troublesome person, for a persistent borrower, a financial parasite. By 1925 the noun <i>bot</i> was translated to a verb, and as a result we have <i>to bot,</i> to borrow money, to impose on others, and <i>botting</i>, the practice. <i>To bot on</i> a person is widely used.

A piece of raw hide known as a knocker is now used to prevent the shears clashing when closed, but before this was introduced the clack and snap of steel meeting steel was a noise inseparable from any busy shearing shed.

Very seldom was harness used, and then without winkers, and it was called branks. The pulling strain came on the bows, and a yoke joined two bows and went over each neck of a pair of bullocks. If there were five pairs, say, a chain ran from the yoke of the first pair to the yoke of the second pair, and another chain from the second to the third, and another chain from the third to the fourth. These chains were lighter between the first pairs and heavier as you got further back. The two rear bullocks were yoked to the pole of the dray or waggon. As there were no reins, the driving was all by commands and cracking the whip. The calls were `Get up' or `Gee up' to start, `Whoa' to stop, `Come here' to turn to left, and `Gee off' to turn right. If you came to a sharp corner, you would often say persuasively, `Way! Way! Come here.'' There is a general impression that bullocks could not be successfully driven without roaring oaths and curses at them, but this idea is a relic of early-day humour.

## bulkie
 
 <i>n.</i> shortened form of "bulk tonnage operator" [King (24/3/1999) says bulk tonnage operators were firms which developed from the 1960 in reaction to the then regulations limiting road competition with rail. These firms consolidated small lots of goods into wagon lot, thus creating "bulk" goods (from the Railways perspective) out of much smaller units. Their workers did not in fact "load bulk goods" - it was the result of their working that the goods became "bulk". Such firms still exist; their current formal name is "freight forwarders" although one hears bulk tonnage operatore or "BTO" occasionally. Examples include Mainfreight and Daily Freight... Given that the expanded name of "bulk tonnage operator" is some thirty years older than [your] example, I would be surprised if its contraction is not also somewhere recorded earlier than 1991.]

>  <b>VON HAAST</b> If the English sailors have acquired a not undeserved reputation for their curses, surely the New Zealand bullock-drivers must be reckoned superior to them in this accomplishment, for such an assortment of fantastic oaths from all kingdoms of Nature, Heaven and Hell I have never heard before from mortal lips. Astounded I listened to this blue-eyed son of Albion and was at last impelled to ask him why he cursed so horribly; it could serve no purpose and only made the beast more stubborn. `You don't understand, Sir,' the young man answered. `I'm only speaking the bullock language. The animal certainly wouldn't understand or obey me if I spoke to him as I would to my horse. The bullock has been brought up to carry in this way, and if I want to get on fast, I've got to talk to him like this.' To this argument advanced by the driver with a good-natured smile I naturally could find no reply. I refer it to the linguists to enrol this new language in the appropriate family of dialects.

 <i>n.</i> a children's game

>  <b>SUTTON-SMITH</b> Another play unknown at a later date was the widespread Bullock Teams: It was easy to make a team of working bullocks from pieces of supplejack, with their opposite branches doing duty as horns.

Whether one uses bush-line or snow-line depends upon the locality of the speaker, or the point of view of the speaker, e.g. a bushman would be more likely to speak of the bush-line, a mountaineer of the snow-line. bush-line and snow-line are only occas. synonymous. e.g. in mountain-country, in the summer, when snow is lying high or has disappeared, the bush-line stands out clearly, but is often called (locally and colloquially) `the snow-line': (cf. also scrub-line).

Even those later scientists who use <i>forest</i> as a general rule usually write of <i>bushmen, bush tracks, patches of bush</i>, and the <i>bushline. </i> <i>Ibid.</i> 24 <i>Bushline</i>, the upper limit of the bush, would be the <i>timberline</i> in North America. Hudson [G.V. Hudson 1890 TrNZI 2/181] used it in 1890 as if it were then well established. It does not seem to have been noted in any dictionary and is probably a word indigenous to New Zealand.

>  <b>GRAHAM</b> GREENBONE, BUTTERFISH, KELP SALMON, or KELPIE (MARARI) <i>Coridodax pullus</i> (Bloch and Schneider) ... The name Greenbone is given on account of the bones being a bright green colour, which is so permanent as to with-stand boiling or bleaching. ... The name kelp-fish is given on account of its habit of feeding on kelp or seaweed, and also because it likes to make its home among kelp. In such a habitat it has both food and a favourite home. Kelp-salmon is given for two reasons. The first part, kelp, is explained in the last paragraph, while the second half, salmon, is because the fish is not unlike a Salmon in shape, so much so that new chums who caught this fish have been under the impression they had caught the protected introduced Salmon, but of that later in this chapter. But why this dark coloured fish should receive the name Butterfish I am unable to say. It is certainly not as some people suggest because it needs butter with it when cooked or eaten. In Auckland the fish known to South Islanders as Spotty (<i>Pseudolabrus celidotus</i>) is called Butterfish on account of its bright golden colouring on the lower parts of the body and fins fancifully resembling the colour of butter. The name Kelpie, of course, is derived from its habit of living amidst kelp and it is easily understood how the `ie' was tacked on by fishermen. (1956 -- ,NZ Fishes: An Identification Guide,261)

Butterfish or Greenbone are possibly the more generally used names for this fish but it should be remembered that in the North Island the Spotty (<i>Pseudolabrus celidotus</i>), a very different fish, is related to the Butterfish there is superficially little resemblance between the two species. <i>Ibid.</i> 169 Butterfish Coridodax pullus Greenbone; Kelp Salmon; Kelpi; Kelpfish (1957 -- ,Sea Anglers' Fishes of NZ,129)

## BYO
 
 <i>abbr.</i> bring your own: the usual notice at restaurants not fully licensed to sell liquor.

>  Most of our cities and even small towns have restaurants that offer and wine service and / or allow patrons to bring their own wine. Not many diners know that the BYO concept originated in Australia and New Zealand during the 1960s and 70s and is rarely found elsewhere. The antipodean origin is acknowledged in the authoritative Oxford Companion to Wine. (Apr 25, 1999 -- ,NZ Catholic,17)

>  We stopped BYO for larger groups two years ago. All they were interested in doing was bringing in a couple of cases of booze and having a party at our expense... You want BYO, he says, then you go to a restaurant, probably an ethnic restaurant or cafe, where you get good cheap food that doesn't take a great deal of preparation and few staff. That's the sort of restaurant that can afford to do BYO. (Dec 18, 1999 -- ,Dominion,23)

(Mar 24, 2001 -- ,Dominion,23)

>  Inside, on the walls, are black and white photographs of early Plimmerton, and the cafe is one of the last of a species fast facing extinction in central Wellington - the BYO restaurant. Twenty-five years ago, "BYO restaurant" had exciting, avant-garde connotations of a new breed of restauranteur, intent on providing a hip, casual alternative to the handful of stiff, expensive, fully licensed fine dining restaurants which, aspart from hotels and a scattering of tired old steak and chip grill-roomns, previously comprised the sum total of the New Zealand dining-out experience.

>  The need for a provision of this nature - sometimes known as BYOG, "bring your own grog" - has been widely recognised and provides a clear enough example of a case where the present law has fallen into disrepute because of its unreasonableness. (1976 -- ,NZ Parliamentary Debates,407 : 3561)
