## Bank of New Zealand

In the basket its maker put a supper, the food cooked at home ... [151] Now on the night of the basket social, all the baskets would be handed in ... They would then be auctioned, and the purchaser of the basket would have the pleasure and the honour of having supper with the provider of the basket. ...

 <i>n.</i>



 
 <i>n.</i> a device for separating gold dust from crushed rock

>  The blanket tailings or blanketings, as they are otherwise called, consist mostly of iron pyrites and other sulphides, cobines with quartz, and contain a fair proportion of gold ...that had escaped over the silver tables. These tailings are treated in berdans with extra quicksilver and ground up. The berdans now in use at the Thames ... are generally five feet in diameter ... At one time a couple of rotating balls were considered sufficient for the amount of crushing required; now, the general practice is to have a loose ball as well as a stationary one attached to a chain, and it is called a drag ball; this drag does more work than a loose ball ... for the drag grinds the bowl as much as the tailings. <i>(1876,TrNZI,8/179</i>) [NOTES: (Goodall Thames Gold-fields)]

The iron block stays still, grinding the ore into a slime. Water flows into the dish and spills over the edge carrying the lighter gold-free particles and slurry with it. Then mercury is added to absorb or amalgamate the gold and silver. It's usually used for testing the ore. <i>(1971,Maratoto Gold,54</i>)

This method of building up saleable lines is generally used in the case of small parcels of fleece wool and bales of oddments which cannot be included in the main lines without destroying their evenness.

## birch
 
 <i>n.</i> (any of a group of deciduous, Northern Hemisphere trees with slender branches and smooth bark, used for timber.) In NZ commonly, but incorrectly, applied to the native beech spp.; a common popular name c1795-1970s for the trees and timber of <i>Nothofagus</i> spp., preferred common name beech q.v. Also occas. used for species of other general thought to resemble Nothofagus. occas. (usu. overseas usage) New Zealand birch. As with beech, vernacular naming tries to distinguish var. and spp. by ref. to colour of bark, texture of wood or timber, appearance of leaf, etc., but with similar confusion and local variation.

Woe betide us if we referred to birch trees in our correspondence with Head Office: we were reminded that it was <i>beech</i> and given all sorts of advice telling us that the botanical name was something like <i>Fagus fagusti</i>, and so on. Some people are allergic to beech trees and the local name for this allergic condition was birch itch. On one occasion a compensatory claim was sent to Wellington advising that the condition suffered was birch itch. Back came a reprimand about this use of the term birch - it should be <i>beech</i>, Head Office pointed out. Nothing was done about this until one day it came to the notice of our chief. He was quick to reply and acknowledge that the trees were beech, not birch, but the itch suffered by the men was birch itch not beech itch. It was locally named by them, and as far as his staff were concerned they used the term birch itch to describe the allergy caused by beech trees. There was no further comment from the Moguls in Head Office. <i>(1975,Men of the Milford Road,93</i>) [NOTES: (Griffiths Collection)]

>  <i>Birch</i>. Various species of Nothofagus. There are various kinds (white, red, black etc.) of trees in New Zealand called birches. They are all really beeches and the newspapers and forestry people are trying to get them so called, but up country they are still always called birches. Birch (creeks, hill, etc.) is one of the commonest components of local names in the South Island. ([1898 Morris Austral-English], and an unpublished letter to Hunter Brown from Dr Hodgkinson, August 9, 1854.) <i>(Sep 16, 1933,Press, The,15</i>) [NOTES: Acland Glossary]



 
 <i>n.</i>

>  <i>Fagus Solandri.</i> - The most common name of this tree is `black-birch,' but it has several other names. In the Wellington and Marlborough districts it is called `black-birch'; in Canterbury it is called `black-birch,' `white-birch,' `red-birch,' and `brown-birch'; in Otago it is known as `white-birch,' `black-birch,' or black-heart birch.' Young specimens of this tree that have no dark heart-wood are often called `white-birch.' This tree is a beech, and it would do away with confusion if it was called `black-beech'. <i>Fagus Menziesii. </i>- The commonest name of this tree is `silver-birch,' but it is often called `brown-birch,' `red-birch,' and `white-birch' [308] in different localities. It would be best to call it `silver-beech,'though it is gaining an Australasian reputation as `Southland beech.' <i>Fagus fusca. </i>- In Auckland this tree is called `black-birch'; in Wellington `red-birch'; in Nelson, Marlborough and Westland it is called `brown-birch'; and in Otago it is called both `red-birch' and `bull-birch.' The most suitable name is `red-beech.' <i>(1918,NZ Journal of Science & Technology,1/307</i>)

>  The utmost confusion prevails among the common names of the birches. There are scarcely two districts, a few miles apart, in which the same name is applied to the same tree, and a similar result may be obtained by consulting two bushmen in the same bush. With a view to obviating this difficulty Mr Kirk suggests `the adoption of new names based of the obvious characteristics of foliage [e.g.] for Fagus fusca `tooth-leaved beech' ... <i>(1876,TrNZI,64</i>) [NOTES: (Blair)]

>  [this cit. not spec. repeated in individual entries] [In Oxford Forest] I learned that the tree [F. solandri, entire-leaved beech ] was termed [red, brown, white, black, and yellow] birch at different stages of its growth, but the application of these terms differed greatly; perhaps Black Birch was most generally applied to the mature condition before decay commenced, and White birch to the young state; but there were too many exceptions to allow the names to be anything but misleading. <i>(1885,TrNZI,17/300</i>) [NOTES: (Kirk, NZ Beeches)]

>  The perversity with which the true `beeches' have become popularly known as `birches,' and different kinds of `mapau' as `maples - a popular name which includes small trees of widely distinct Natural Order, is enough to fill with despair any botanist who desires to foster a system of popular names that will be free from misleading and inaccurate suggestions. <i>(1891,NZ Journal of Science,1/50</i>)

>  '... the term birch may be regarded as a generic name applied by bushmen to any small-leaved tree, and qualified by the prefixes `black', `white' or `red' at the caprice of the individual or as may be suggested by the colour of its foliage, bark or timber.' So the term `black birch' was in many districts applied to Pittosporum tenuifolium [ ] and to Weinmannia racemosa [Kamahi] in Otago - the latter tree being also known as `brown birch' or `red birch.' Myrsine Urvillei [ ] was known as `red birch', and Carpodetus serratus [ ] and Quintinia serrata [ ] as `white birch.' It was principally to the trees of the species Nothofagus (then known a Fagus), that the term `birch' was applied, and a distinguishing of the various kinds by the prefixing of a descriptive word was a step in the right direction; but in this instance the step was on a path that led to a quagmire. To take only the instance of N. Solandri (formerly Fagus Solandri). [v. 1885 Kirk] ... The confusion created has been endless ; it has at times even resulted in commercial loss ; [v. (Morris) 1889 Kirk `Forest Flora of NZ p.91] yet so strong is habit that confusion was preferred before a change of name. And, indeed, the bushmen might well ask what name they should adopt ; for the scientists came and added to the confusion by pointing out that the trees usually called `birch' were not birch at all, but `beech' - when a fresh crop of names resulted.: `black beech', `red beech', `dusky beech', etc. The scientists themselves, however, in calling the species Nothofagus, `beech', took care - that is, usually took care - to make the distinguishing prefix one that would not lead to a repetition of the old confusion. N. Solanderi was accordingly called `entire-leaved beech' ; N. Cliffortioides, `mountain beech' ; N. Menziesii, `round-leaved beech' ; N. fusca `tooth-leaved beech'. It was some time before even these names were agreed upon ; and `silver beech' finally took the place of `round-leaved beech' for N. Menziesii. A note may here be made of the fact that, whilst the entire-leaved beech was Fagus Solandri, on Fagus being changed to Nothofagus, Solandri was altered to Solanderi ; but this has been altered back again to Solandri ; for that was the original and not incorrect spelling of the word. <i>(1926,TrNZI,56-57/663</i>) [NOTES: Andersen Popular Names ff Kirk in 1875 [Reports on the Durability of N.Z. Timber 16]]

>  <b>LAING & BLACKWELL</b> ... it is perhaps futile to hope that the more exact name [beech] will become popular ; but we might at least expect some consistent nomenclature to be adopted through the islands. At present the various species are designated almost indifferently, white, red, black, silver birch etc. What is white birch in one part of the country may be black in another ... The use of the name <i>birch</i> in place of <i>beech</i> is inexcusable, though ... N. Menziesii ... [shows] some external resemblance to the English birch. <i>(1940,NZ Plants,136</i>)

>  Colour Coding [heading] ... St Patrick's Day sports organiser, Mr Lyn Thompson yesterday inquired about the difference between red, black and brown birch. It was `clearly' explained for him by a prominent axeman, Mr Bill Evans. The bark of the red birch is silver, but the timber is pink when it's green. Brown birch often has black bark, but the green timber is red. Sometimes the bark of the black birch is white, but the timber is yellow and sometimes it's brown when it's green. <i>(Mar 11, 1972,Otago Daily Times,1</i>) [NOTES: (Griffiths Collection)]

Woe betide us if we referred to birch trees in our correspondence with Head Office: we were reminded that it was <i>beech</i> and given all sorts of advice telling us that the botanical name was something like <i>Fagus fagusti,</i> and so on. Some people are allergic to beech trees and the local name for this allergic condition was birch itch. On one occasion a compensatory claim was sent to Wellington advising that the condition suffered was birch itch. Back came a reprimand about this use of the term birch - it should be <i>beech</i>, Head Office pointed out. Nothing was done about this until one day it came to the notice of our chief. He was quick to reply and acknowledge that the trees were beech, not birch, but the itch suffered by the men was birch itch not beech itch. It was locally named by them, and as far as his staff were concerned they used the term birch itch to describe the allergy caused by beech trees. <i>(1975,Men of the Milford Road,93</i>) [NOTES: (Griffiths Collection)]

Nordmeyer's budget [of June 1958] was remembered as `the black budget' for many years. It can be argued that it was good for `the country'. For the government it was a suicidal mistake. It was the biggest blunder in Nash's political career. Although he was not immediately and directly responsible, he was the leader and did not say `No'. <i>(1976,Nash,309</i>)

>  Better or not the officially sanctioned substitute was announced early in August and the Gal Blacks of brief notoriety (along with other canvassed names such as Elle Blacks and She Bs - after ABs) were finally history. The team was henceforth to be known as the Black Ferns. Here the colour adjective fittingly remains, and the noun echoes the name sported (since the early 1990s) by another black-clad international New Zealand women's team, the netballers or Silver Ferns. Since that title itself derives from the famous fernleaf-cum-national symbol of the All Black jersey (to wear the silver fern is a common variant of to be an All Black), there is an obvious appropriateness in reapplying the fern to the rugby union context. Black Ferns is further legitimised bv the presence in the natural world of a black (tree-) fern, in Maori the mamaku. <i>(Jan 1999,NZWords,2(1) : 5</i>)

At one time a couple of rotating balls were considered sufficient for the amount of crushing required; now, the general practice is to have a loose ball as well as a stationary one attached to a chain, and it is called a drag ball; this drag does more work than a loose ball ... for the drag grinds the bowl as much as the tailings. <i>(1876,TrNZI,8/179</i>)

Very seldom was harness used, and then without winkers, and it was called branks. The pulling strain came on the bows, and a yoke joined two bows and went over each neck of a pair of bullocks. If there were five pairs, say, a chain ran from the yoke of the first pair to the yoke of the second pair, and another chain from the second to the third, and another chain from the third to the fourth. These chains were lighter between the first pairs and heavier as you got further back. The two rear bullocks were yoked to the pole of the dray or waggon. As there were no reins, the driving was all by commands and cracking the whip. The calls were `Get up' or `Gee up' to start, `Whoa' to stop, `Come here' to turn to left, and `Gee off' to turn right. If you came to a sharp corner, you would often say persuasively, `Way! Way! Come here.'' There is a general impression that bullocks could not be successfully driven without roaring oaths and curses at them, but this idea is a relic of early-day humour. <i>(1947,Early Runholding in Otago,42</i>)

Instead, it is the brat pack who, along with Shipley, are intended to be National's energetic, new public face. English in Finance, Nick Smith in Education, Tony Ryall in Justice and Sowry in Social Services are attempting to make the running by a series of announcements in their portfolios. <i>(Apr 18, 1999,Sunday Star Times,C3</i>)

>  [Bill English] has become angrier and angrier watching Labour campaign against himself and his closest colleagues, in particular the three other (comparatively) young ministers known as the Brat Pack. <i>(May 1, 1999,Listener (New Zealand Listener),16</i>)

## bulkie
 
 <i>n.</i> shortened form of "bulk tonnage operator" [King (24/3/1999) says bulk tonnage operators were firms which developed from the 1960 in reaction to the then regulations limiting road competition with rail. These firms consolidated small lots of goods into wagon lot, thus creating "bulk" goods (from the Railways perspective) out of much smaller units. Their workers did not in fact "load bulk goods" - it was the result of their working that the goods became "bulk". Such firms still exist; their current formal name is "freight forwarders" although one hears bulk tonnage operatore or "BTO" occasionally. Examples include Mainfreight and Daily Freight... Given that the expanded name of "bulk tonnage operator" is some thirty years older than [your] example, I would be surprised if its contraction is not also somewhere recorded earlier than 1991.]

The thin yet firm texture of the leaf, the prominent veins, the sharply-toothed margins, are characters that can only be confused with those afforded by a careless observer.

Astounded I listened to this blue-eyed son of Albion and was at last impelled to ask him why he cursed so horribly; it could serve no purpose and only made the beast more stubborn. `You don't understand, Sir,' the young man answered. `I'm only speaking the bullock language. The animal certainly wouldn't understand or obey me if I spoke to him as I would to my horse. The bullock has been brought up to carry in this way, and if I want to get on fast, I've got to talk to him like this.'

## bushfelling
 
 <i>n.</i> the falling or cutting down of timber trees or bush A1; =bush-falling (bush-falling is the common term; bush-felling is uncommon, and would seem slightly pedantic or `Englishy'. (See [cit. bush-falling 1933](../C#cit.-bush-falling-1933))

Road-making on a 50/50 basis with the local bodies, ohu or mahi-apu [ed fn: A group of volunteer workers] in relation to scrub-cutting, bush felling, splitting posts and battens, gave ample evidence of self-help. <i>(May 22, 1930,Na To Hoa Aroha,2/34,1987 ed.</i>) [NOTES: (Ngata)]

## bushline
 
 <i>n.</i> the timber-line; the upper limit of the growth of bush A1 on a mountain; height at which bush ceases to grow (cf. timber-line (OED 1835) is occas. used in N.Z; cf. and cp. snow-line, which is more often used in the SI mountain-country. Whether one uses bush-line or snow-line depends upon the locality of the speaker, or the point of view of the speaker, e.g. a bushman would be more likely to speak of the bush-line, a mountaineer of the snow-line. bush-line and snow-line are only occas. synonymous. e.g. in mountain-country, in the summer, when snow is lying high or has disappeared, the bush-line stands out clearly, but is often called (locally and colloquially) `the snow-line': (cf. also scrub-line).

>  Although above the bush line, there will be abundance of wood within convenient distance. <i>(Feb 13, 1899,Taranaki Herald,3</i>)

>  We may speak of kauri forest or beech forest, but we get lost in the bush, fight bush fires, and climb above the bushline. The kauri forest, like the mixed podocarp forest, the sub-tropical rain forest, ... and such-like are terms that come from the botanist and forester, not from the layman - or from the bushman. ... Even those later scientists who use <i>forest</i> as a general rule usually write of <i>bushmen, bush tracks, patches of bush</i>, and the <i>bushline. </i> <i>Ibid.</i> 24 <i>Bushline</i>, the upper limit of the bush, would be the <i>timberline</i> in North America. Hudson [G.V. Hudson 1890 TrNZI 2/181] used it in 1890 as if it were then well established. It does not seem to have been noted in any dictionary and is probably a word indigenous to New Zealand. <i>(1958,Tararua,23</i>) [NOTES: Ruth Mason `Track and Trail']

>  <b>PICKERING</b> Above the bushline the environment is less inviting. The bush is generally a friend to trampers as it provides the two crucial necessities of shelter and fuel. Only when you emerge from the forest onto the bare tops do you realise how generous a protector the bush is. ...

>  <b>GRAHAM</b> GREENBONE, BUTTERFISH, KELP SALMON, or KELPIE (MARARI) <i>Coridodax pullus</i> (Bloch and Schneider) ... The name Greenbone is given on account of the bones being a bright green colour, which is so permanent as to with-stand boiling or bleaching. ... The name kelp-fish is given on account of its habit of feeding on kelp or seaweed, and also because it likes to make its home among kelp. In such a habitat it has both food and a favourite home. Kelp-salmon is given for two reasons. The first part, kelp, is explained in the last paragraph, while the second half, salmon, is because the fish is not unlike a Salmon in shape, so much so that new chums who caught this fish have been under the impression they had caught the protected introduced Salmon, but of that later in this chapter. But why this dark coloured fish should receive the name Butterfish I am unable to say. It is certainly not as some people suggest because it needs butter with it when cooked or eaten. In Auckland the fish known to South Islanders as Spotty (<i>Pseudolabrus celidotus</i>) is called Butterfish on account of its bright golden colouring on the lower parts of the body and fins fancifully resembling the colour of butter. The name Kelpie, of course, is derived from its habit of living amidst kelp and it is easily understood how the `ie' was tacked on by fishermen. <i>(1956,NZ Fishes: An Identification Guide,261</i>)

>  <b>PARROTT</b> The Butterfish is very similar in form, and is related to, the Kelpfish (<i>Odax vittatus</i>), which is also a brightly-coloured species and found in similar situations, feeding on kelp and other marine plants in rocky localities. <i>Ibid.</i> 130 It is unfortunate that the Butterfish has been given a variety of local names which have originated either from their habit of associating with kelp, their body form, or from the colour of their bones, as for example, Kelpfish, Kelp-salmon, Greenbone, and several other names not so easy to explain. Butterfish or Greenbone are possibly the more generally used names for this fish but it should be remembered that in the North Island the Spotty (<i>Pseudolabrus celidotus</i>), a very different fish, is related to the Butterfish there is superficially little resemblance between the two species. <i>Ibid.</i> 169 Butterfish Coridodax pullus Greenbone; Kelp Salmon; Kelpi; Kelpfish <i>(1957,Sea Anglers' Fishes of NZ,129</i>)

## BYO
 
 <i>abbr.</i> bring your own: the usual notice at restaurants not fully licensed to sell liquor.

>  Most of our cities and even small towns have restaurants that offer and wine service and / or allow patrons to bring their own wine. Not many diners know that the BYO concept originated in Australia and New Zealand during the 1960s and 70s and is rarely found elsewhere. The antipodean origin is acknowledged in the authoritative Oxford Companion to Wine. <i>(Apr 25, 1999,NZ Catholic,17</i>)

>  The interior recalls an almost vanished era - that of the BYO bistro. <i>(Nov 30, 1999,Evening Post,19</i>)

>  We stopped BYO for larger groups two years ago. All they were interested in doing was bringing in a couple of cases of booze and having a party at our expense... You want BYO, he says, then you go to a restaurant, probably an ethnic restaurant or cafe, where you get good cheap food that doesn't take a great deal of preparation and few staff. That's the sort of restaurant that can afford to do BYO. <i>(Dec 18, 1999,Dominion,23</i>)

>  They had that BYO sort of look about them and let me bare all. It's that sort of place. <i>(Jul 19, 2003,Dominion Post,F6</i>)

>  I don't want to buy into a punch-up over the BYO syndrome, but this tell-tale brown-bag routine is something I shy away from. It's pretty much an Australian and New Zealand thing to ferry our own drinkies into restaurants, sometimes even transporting them in a designer bag, suitably labelled, and drawing attention to the fact that l'il ole me is bringing my own. <i>(Mar 24, 2001,Dominion,23</i>)

>  Inside, on the walls, are black and white photographs of early Plimmerton, and the cafe is one of the last of a species fast facing extinction in central Wellington - the BYO restaurant. Twenty-five years ago, "BYO restaurant" had exciting, avant-garde connotations of a new breed of restauranteur, intent on providing a hip, casual alternative to the handful of stiff, expensive, fully licensed fine dining restaurants which, aspart from hotels and a scattering of tired old steak and chip grill-roomns, previously comprised the sum total of the New Zealand dining-out experience. <i>(Jun 5, 2003,Dominion Post,D4</i>)

>  BYO ad functions illegal, police say ... Senior Sergeant Max Moore said this when commenting on recent advertisements on radio and newspapers in Oamaru advertising functions as `bring your own liquor.' <i>Ibid.</i> 14 Dining with members of the Collard family at Chatterleys byo restaurant in Auckland recently was a truly gastronomic and vinous experience. <i>(Jul 11, 1986,Evening Post,11</i>)

>  There have been times when I have spent a whole five minutes deciding which BYO to go out to, and another half hour deciding which wine to take. <i>(Sep 8, 1986,Campus News,5</i>)

>  <b>4</b> It has always surprised me that more restaurants don't open them - particularly the smaller BYOs which are mainly owner-operated. <i>(Dec 8, 1989,Contact (Wgtn)</i>)

>  The menu of Le Saucier, the new BYO in lower Cuba Street, more or less speaks for itself. <i>(May 1986,Wellington City Magazine,86</i>)

>  The need for a provision of this nature - sometimes known as BYOG, "bring your own grog" - has been widely recognised and provides a clear enough example of a case where the present law has fallen into disrepute because of its unreasonableness. <i>(1976,NZ Parliamentary Debates,407 : 3561</i>)
