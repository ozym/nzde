They are of the same genus with the cocoa-nut tree ; like it they have very large pinnated leaves, and are the same sort as the second sort found in the northern parts of New South Wales [vide Hawkesworth Voyages Vol 3].

The remarks that the leaves are pinnate, that each tree produces but one cabbage, and that the cutting of it destroys the tree, lead one to suspect that the tree referred to is not a Cordyline. The entry in the Journal was made at Norfolk Island, not New Zealand, but there is no indication in Cook as to what tree is referred to. ... A more definite clue in Banks (Journal of the Rt Hon Sir Joseph Banks during Captain Cook's First Voyage ... 1768-77, London, 1896 p227), where he writes of New zealand [sic] plants ... A footnote identifies the [`cabbage-tree'] as Areca Sapida Soland. ... [Nikau] ... `very closely related to the Norfolk Island A. Baueri which is a larger plant' [Hooker]. [Banks] says nothing of the eating of the young shoots of the Cordyline.

Cheeseman, too, says, `Universally known to New Zealand residents by the inappropriate name of ""cabbage-tree""' (Cheeseman, Manual NZ Flora p707).

Butler remarks `The cabbage-tree or ti-palm is not a true palm, though it looks like one. It has not the least resemblance to a cabbage.' The settlers and bushmen followed Cook in using the young heart as a vegetable, and in their naming of the tree ; and when the reason for the name is known its inapproriateness disappears. To one section of the public it will always be the cabbage-tree ; to the other section, let it be lily-palm. `Ti-tree' and ti-palm' should certainly be banned, because of the hopeless confusion with tea-tree.

Fastened to this stick was a piece of stout fishing line about three to four feet in length, carrying a piece of red-coloured wood - usually cedar - about five to six inches in length. A bent nail was secured to this piece of wood in the form of a hook but no bait was used. When a school of Barracouta was found the Couta stick, or paw, was brought out ready for fishing. From the cockpit of the launch the piece of wood with the nail was violently swirled with a circular motion in and out of the water, causing a disturbance of the water in a good imitation of a number of Sprats, Pilchards or other small fish jumping in and out of the sea. The Barracouta would swim for such a place. Seeing the piece of red wood moving rapidly through the water they would take it for a fish, snap at it or even jump out of the water for the lure and were caught by the crude iron hook. As the fish was hooked during the time the paw was being drawn through the water the fisherman would swing the fish over his head above the boat or launch and when the caught fish was midway in the air, more or less above the cockpit, would expertly give the stick a dexterous smart twist. As there was no barb on the hook the fish was released and fell into the cockpit.",

When the European fisherman called his fishing outfit [315] `paw', the Maori uses the term `pa'. This fish was a great favourite with them and was caught in large numbers. On returning to the shore, the women cleaned the fish and then hung them up on racks to dry in the sun. Old Maoris of Opotiki told me they used a chip of Tawhai (<i>Nothofagus fusca</i>), which is dark red, in the making of a pa (paw).",

It was, broadly speaking, an open box with the sides sloping inwards towards the base, and the bottom board extended about a foot beyond the end; while the end board, which formed one of the sides, did not reach to the bottom, but left an aperture. The box was fitted on top with an iron hopper punched full of quarter-inch holes and with sides about three inches high. It was into this hopper that the gold-bearing gravel was thrown, a shovelful at a time.",
cradle,1946,There Was Gold,MILLER,41 (cont.),,"It took two men to work the cradle satisfactorily - one to shovel and one to rock it violently by means of a handle that was fastened up the back end of the contraption, and at the same time to dash water on to it by means of a dipper fastened to a stick. The cradle was always placed, of course, at the water's edge, and the stones that did not fall through the hopper were tipped out the front end, which was left without any retaining side. The material which was washed through the holes, and which contained the gold, fell straight down on to a sloping wooden table covered with a coarse piece of matting on which the gold was saved. The table was fitted firmly against the back and sides of the box, but stopped short about an inch from the front end to allow the tailings and what gold was not saved to fall on to another table - this one fitting firmly to the front end and the sides, and sloping dowm towards the back end. From there the tailings fell on to the back end of the bottom board, which was generally covered with coconut matting to catch any gold that might have gone all the distance, and followed along the bottom and out over the lip. By this means the wash had to travel a surprisingly long distance, and was also shaken from side to side of the cradle, so that there little chance if it was worked properly of losing any gold.",

Before the crawley could crawl off the stick a stone had to be thrown onto the other end of the stick so as to catapult the crawley off the stick and over the cliff. A variation of the same game was being played at Denniston when I visited there in 1949. It was called alternatively `Hit the Crawley' or `Strike the Crayfish'.
