Quote: Writing of the Waimea Plain in 1856: - `The ground was well grassed, but the speargrass was too plentiful. The pasturage was very good. There was a good deal of scrub in the bends of the Mataura known as `wire plant' (Olearia virgata). There were also manuka and koromiko. Maori-heads, a kind of grass tree about three feet high, abounded in the swamps, and in some we saw toitoi grass and raupo. We did not pass any cabbage trees to-day ... we proceeded slowly through tomatakuru scrub, speargrass, Spaniard, snowgrass, and other native grasses ... we camped in a bend with good feed at the Elbow and a swamp on one side. Maori cabbage abounded ...'

Quote: The name `cabbage-tree' was given by Captain Cook's people. ... Journal, 10th October, 1774 : `These cabbage-trees or palms were not thicker than a man's leg, and from ten to twenty feet high. They are of the same genus with the cocoa-nut tree ; like it they have very large pinnated leaves, and are the same sort as the second sort found in the northern parts of New South Wales [vide Hawkesworth Voyages Vol 3]. The cabbage is, properly speaking, the bud of the tree ; each tree producing but one cabbage which is at the crown, where the leaves spring out, and is enclosed in the stem ... -->[Cook, Voyage to Pacific Ocean 1777 Vol II pp 148-9] ... The remarks that the leaves are pinnate, that each tree produces but one cabbage, and that the cutting of it destroys the tree, lead one to suspect that the tree referred to is not a Cordyline. The entry in the Journal was made at Norfolk Island, not New Zealand, but there is no indication in Cook as to what tree is referred to. ... A more definite clue in Banks (Journal of the Rt Hon Sir Joseph Banks during Captain Cook's First Voyage ... 1768-77, London, 1896 p227), where he writes of New zealand [sic] plants ... A footnote identifies the [`cabbage-tree'] as Areca Sapida Soland. ... [Nikau] ... `very closely related to the Norfolk Island A. Baueri which is a larger plant' [Hooker]. [Banks] says nothing of the eating of the young shoots of the Cordyline. It would appear, then, that primarily the term `cabbage-tree', `cabbage-palm' was applied to Areca Baueri, but has become transferred exclusively to Cordyline ... [examples and references to Cordyline and Areca in Colenso and others] ...

Quote: One would suppose that Kirk had forgotten the origin of the name when he says, `Settlers and bushmen generally apply the unmeaning [sic] name of "cabbage-tree"' (Kirk, Forest Flora of NZ p295). Cheeseman, too, says, `Universally known to New Zealand residents by the inappropriate name of "cabbage-tree"' (Cheeseman, Manual NZ Flora p707). Thomas explains the name and errs in doing so : `It receives its name from the arrangement of its leaves in tufts or heads at the ends of the branches' (Clark A Southern Cross Fairy-tale p53). Butler remarks `The cabbage-tree or ti-palm is not a true palm, though it looks like one. It has not the least resemblance to a cabbage.' The settlers and bushmen followed Cook in using the young heart as a vegetable, and in their naming of the tree ; and when the reason for the name is known its inapproriateness disappears. To one section of the public it will always be the cabbage-tree ; to the other section, let it be lily-palm. `Ti-tree' and ti-palm' should certainly be banned, because of the hopeless confusion with tea-tree. The Canterbury form ti (-tree, -palm) is obs. Originally from Maori name for the tree, `ti', it was confused with tea-tree (`Manuka', Leptospermum sp) see Acland.

Since the backblocks are already called the <i>woop woops</i> (the form given by Partridge who says it is mainly restricted to New South Wales: I know the word but think of it as<i> wook wooks</i>), the sticks, the tea tree and <i>the cactus</i>, some semantic differentiation is not impossible. It must be pointed out that my meaning for <i>up the boo-ay</i> is already supplied by <i> up the chute,</i> however.

In a `Calcutta' subscripters are ... 1 pound each ... and are not governed by the number of horses in the race upon which the sweep is based. Slips of paper with the horses written on then placed in a hat and in another hat - names of subscribers. Promoter ... takes role of auctioneer ... each horse drawn offered at auction and sold to highest bidder ... full amount bid has only to be paid if the buyer is not the drawer of that particular horse. If the drawer should buy the horse in, then he pays only half the amount bid, and the money goes into the pool. If the buyer does not draw the horse, the amount bid is divided, half to the drawer and half to the pool.

This was a common practice in those days and now that it seems to be a thing of the past it might be worth describing. The evening before the event concerned the crowd would get together and every dog on the programme would be put up for `auction'. The proceeds of the `sale' would be pooled, divided into first, second and third money, and after the actual event was finished this went to the men who had `purchased' the placed dogs.

Quote: [The] system, known casually as the Calcutta sweep, is practised in most clubs round the country and makes amateur golfers wealthy men through golf as an amateur sport. Basically, the idea works on the system of paired golfers who compete for prize-money put up by their fellow club-members ... The pairs are deemed horses and are bought at local club auctions by other club members. And it is at those auctions that anything happens ... The competition is usually run on a match-play basis with the winning couple collecting half of what they have won while the `owner' who bought them gets the other half ... I know of one team that went for $3 all up and won a calcutta.

The expression as a whole, however, may mean something like `bite (a person's) ear off ; chew the lug off' - `talk pointedly' sarcastically too much and too loud; nag viciously').

It is an iron pot about fifteen inches diameter, six inches deep, with straightly sloping sides, the top being about an inch or so wider than the bottom. The lid is slightly concave on the lower side, and has a looped handle on top at the centre. The whole is either slung over the fire by means of a big, looped handle, the ends of which are loosely affixed to loops on the outer sides of the oven or stood over coals.

Quote: SIR, Your news item of May 11, `Unashamedly Cantabrian' quotes the chairman of a Christchurch City Council committee saying some development project was `unashamedly parochial and unashamedly Cantabrian.' -->this adjective for `pertaining to Canterbury' rouses my curiosity. The word Canterbury itself is quite capable of being used as an adjective - Canterbury bells, Canterbury gallop (hence `canter') John Brooke-White? [The following in bold type.] The `Post's' chief reader Ian Spicer says `Cantabrian' to describe a resident of, or phenomenon related to Canterbury - and more particularly Christchurch - has been around for a long time. Usage appears to be peculiar to Christchurch newspapers and some individuals, perhaps as a means of reinforcing some quaint notions held by them about the city's Englishness. Arguments about the word have waxed at least as long with Canterburians being preferred by some as being etymologically more valid. However, Canterburians looks awkward and is a mouthful to pronounce: for those reasons, Cantabrian appears to have scored the victory.

When released the poor beast is not in an amiable temper ...

Quote: When the word is given to start, the shearers go into the `catching-pen' and feel over the sheep, select one, carry it out on to the shearing-floor, and commence shearing. Naturally, the easiest-shorn sheep -- `bare-bellies' and `bare points' -- are selected first. It is amusing to watch the tactics of some of the shearers to dodge the Kapara (Cobbler) the last sheep in the pen, which, presumably, is the worst shearing sheep of the lot.

Quote: Three years ago a group of leading producers of farmed venison made a bold move. Believing that the word "venison" conjured up something wild, gamy and tough, which weekend hunters might bring down from the hills and give away to friends, they decided to rename their meat... However, cervena was to be more than just a name. It was also to be a trademark that would guarantee quality. In addition, heeding the lesson learnt from kiwifruit growers after they renamed their product, the name cervena would also be registered as an appellation.

Notes: R. Gilberd (milling Okaihau, Northland) The old method of tightening the chain securing logs to trucks is called `twitching' or `taking a twitch.' First the chain is fastened leaving it quite slack. A lever is passed through the bight and used to twist the slack up on itself. When chain is tight enough the end of the lever is tied to the chain. A `chain-rack' is now used - a giant Hayes wire-strainer. It is sometimes, but improperly, called a `twitch.' `Twitch' is probably an amalgamation of `twist' and `pitch.'

Quote: The French word, "Charrette" means "cart" and is often used to describe the final, intense work effort expended by art and architecture students to meet a project deadline. This use of the term is said to originate from the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris during the 19th century, where proctors circulated a cart, or "charrette", to collect final drawings while students frantically put finishing touches on their work.

Quote: A consultant team was appointed by Council this month. They have been asked to independently develop and run a design "charrette".

If support continues, then the team will proceed to the second stage - the holding of a design "charrette" probably some time in November.

Quote: The word "cheeky" quite obviously refers to the plump part of a person's face, and the word "darkie" in our dictionary alludes to people of profound intellectual depth... Cheeky, of course, is what his rounded face is; little is what his height is; and bugger, as we know, is a word coined by an advertising agency meaning "a serendipitous accident". It doesn't mean at all what is used to mean - and that's official.

The latter name apparently derives from the fact that Chinese fish merchants in Dunedin in the early days always kept these fish for their own consumption. Nowadays these fish are more accurately termed Spotted Stargazer

Quote: In New Zealand, chutney, is most often made with fruit, including dried fruit such as raisins. It is usually sweeter than a pickle, and is cooked long enough to develop a thick, jammy consistency. There is a fresh chutney which is made of chopped fresh fruit, herbs or coconut and is served as soon as it is ready. Fresh chutney is closer in style to the original chatni, the Indian word from which chutney is derived, than to the savoury jam that we call chutney, which had its origins in Britain.

Quote: When the word is given to start, the shearers go into the `catching-pen' and feel over the sheep, select one, carry it out on to the shearing-floor, and commence shearing. Naturally, the easiest-shorn sheep -- `bare-bellies' and `bare points' -- are selected first. It is amusing to watch the tactics of some of the shearers to dodge the Kapara (Cobbler) the last sheep in the pen, which, presumably, is the worst shearing sheep of the lot.

Quote: The `wool-shed' where all shearing is done has a row of pens (`catching-pens' they are called) in it reaching from one end to the other, each pen holding some 25-30 sheep. Opposite each of these are two shearers, who draw their sheep one by one out of their pen until the pen is exhausted. Naturally each man tries to pick a sheep that looks easy to shear, so the last one is generally a great ugly brute with matted wool and his fleece full of sand. This fellow is invariably nicknamed the `cobbler.'

Quote: <i>cobbler</i>: The last sheep left in the catching pen (because it was difficult to shear) is called the `cobbler', a play on `the cobbler's last'. Naturally shearers like to make this their `bell sheep'. It was a simple transfer to use the term `cobbler' or `sandy cobbler' to describe a rough hard sheep at any time. .

The name was originally given in contempt (see quotations), but it is now used by farmers themselves. <i>cocky</i> is a common abbreviation. Some people distinguish between a <i>cockatoo</i> and a <i>ground-parrot</i>, the latter being the farmer on a very small scale. Trollope's etymology (see quotation, 1873) will not hold, for it is not true that the cockatoo scratches the ground. After the gold fever <i>circa</i> 1860, the selectors swarmed over the country and ate up the substance of the squatters; hence they were called <i>Cockatoos</i>.

Quote: In the southern Provinces there was fierce competition between the pastoral tenants and the `cockatoos', a name for small farmers which originated in Australia by analogy with the swarms of birds which descended on the land of the luckless farmer at harvest time. It has persisted in New Zealand to the present day in the term `cow cockies' for dairy farmers.

Quote: Montana would, in the 1960s, expand its operations to a 120-hectare vineyard at Mangatangi in the northern Waikato and would soon launch onto the market a concoction which even today lives on in the national memory of a generation - Cold Duck, along with Montana Pearl, was made from siebel bybrid grapes with a touch of sherry material thrown in. Drunk like cordial at student balls, these two - and another Montana line, an orange-flavoured concoction called Poulet Poulet - possibly led to more acts of sexual intercourse than any other contributing factor in the New Zealand of the late 1960s and early 1970s.

Quote: New Zealanders are just as sloppy about their use of the term `college'. Here, a high school may find itself honored with the title of `college'. In America, `college' means only one thing - an institute of higher learning above the high school - the New Zealand `university college'. For this reason confusion often crops up - when someone from Arizona reports the very true fact that [50] `five years of college education are necessary before one can become a high school teacher', he means five years of university work - through the M.A. degree. The New Zealander usually thinks he means one year beyond high school, and therefore thinks of American educational standards as being lower than they are.

[quoting 1898 Reeves Long White Cloud 335-336] ... [48] John Sheehan, one of the ablest ... debaters in the opposition, claimed that the most `inoffensive epithet' he could apply to the government [c1875] was that of the `continuous Government'. [NZPD 1875, 19, p. 60] The `Continuous Ministry' label was established by frequent reiteration. Samuel Hodgkinson ... flatly asserted: `this is a continuous Ministry. There may have been a new material put into it, but it is much the same Ministry as an old garment is the same garment though it has been patched from time to time.' [quoting NZPD, 1877, 26, p. 31]

Quote: Now then for the `Coo-ey'. This corresponds to our English Hoy! Halloa! but is infinitely more puzzling - for the Hoy and the Halloa are generally but preludes to an explicit expression in plain English of the wishes of the Hoyer or the Halloer to the Hoyee or Hallowee respectively. Coo-ey however is far more extended in its signification and is often expected to convey that signification in itself. Coo-ey can be heard for a very very long way - the `Coo-' is dwelt on for some time and the `ey' is brought out sharp and quick in high relief as it were from the Coo - and at an unnaturally high pitch. It requires some courage to give vent to a Coo-ey at first; the first attempts are generally abortive, not to say rather doleful and at the same time ludicrous; by and by however as one gains confidence one's Coo-eys are more successful; my own at present is quite unimpeachable though in [46] England nothing would have induced me to give utterance to such a noise on any consideration.

Quote: We found one of Cook's Medals amongst a heap of rubbish on Iron Island; it was a composite piece, of the size of a penny, on one side, was the head of George the Third, and the other was a representation of 2 ships & `Resolution and Adventure; sailed from England March 1772'. This I foolishly gave away for a trifle, (which I am sorry for as several of my friends would have liked to have had it). [fn] The idea for these brass medals to commemorate the voyage of the <i>Resolution</i> and <i>Adventure</i> came from Joseph Banks. Measuring 42mm in diameter they were struck by Matthew Boulton for the Admiralty (39, vol 2, p. xxix) and distributed to native people during the voyage (Plates 109 and 110). Cook left some of these medals in a Maori canoe on the beach at Cascade Cove in Dusky Bay in March 1773 (39, vol 2, p.113). The medal found by Boultbee fifty-three years later is the only one known to have been found in Dusky Bay (Plate 113).

## "copper Maori"


WordClass: noun

Definition: Copper Maori seems to have been used by Europeans in the North Island (esp. Northland) for the more usual hangi, umu. with <i>copper</i>. The Maori suffix (variously spelt in early texts) is curious. (1) It is used both with its flexionless Maori pl and its anglicised pl in -s. (2) If it is an aj, the placement after the noun follows Maori grammatical usage: a fuller anglicisation would be <i>Maori copper</i>, occas. used. (3) Williams (p?) states that <i>Maori aj and n `native, belonging to New Zealand' is a comparatively recent use not recorded before 1850, and probably first used by Maoris themselves. Is this an early Maori use of the modern sense of Maori? Or an early Pakeha use? (4) Or is it a use of the sense `normal, usual, ordinary' <i>- kopa Maori</i> being the usual earth-oven, perhaps distinct from the iron tripot etc., (then called in English `copper'), the <i>*kopa Pakeha; </i>

## "copper stick"

Notes: Ian Douglas (51 Liverpool St, Wanganui; dougie@xtra.co.nz) says the term used in England 60 years ago was "poss stick" a long wooden stick. "There was also a 'posser' which was a pole with a sort of vacuum creating hood on the end which was used to dump or dunk the clothes up and down and help shift the dirt." John Mihaljevic (jmjm@ihug.co.nz) writes that a BBC World Service My Century documentary (The Invention that Feed Women) broadcast by Radio NZ has a woman born in the East End of London in 1927 describing washdays (presumably the 1930s) and referring to her mother's use of copper sticks. "This was not just any piece of wood, but a specific tool; she described it as a 'one-handled rolling pin'" Alan Burnett (aged 75) writes (2/10/1999) that when he was a child in Scotland "we always spoke of the copper-stick or SPURKLE which was made by cutting a broom-handle in half! and used for poking the boiling clothes.

Quote: COUNTRY QUOTA was a percentage once added to the population of rural electorates to give them what was seen as a fairer balance with urban electorates in general elections. The country quota was first granted in 1881 and was equivalent to one-third of the population added to the actual population of rural constituencies. This was reduced to 18 per cent in 1887 and then increased to 28 per cent in 1889, the figure at which it remained until the country quota was abolished by the Labour Government in 1945.

Quote: The electoral device known as the 'country quota' was first used in New Zealand in 1881 when a 'quota' equivalent to 33 1/3 per cent of the population was added to rural constituencies. In 1887 this was reduced to 18 per cent, but was increased in 1889 to 28 per cent. It remained at this figure until 1945 when it was abolished by the Labour Government. Between 1881 and 1945 the `country quota' was added to the population of rural electorates which, for the purposes of the Electoral Act, meant population other than that contained in a city or borough of over 2,000 inhabitants, or in any area within 5 miles of the chief post offices in Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch, or Dunedin.

Quote: BARRACOUTA (MANGA) <i>Leionura atun dentatus</i> (Bloch and Schneider) INCREDIBLE as it may seem these fish, with their well-armed jaws of sharp fang-like teeth, were usually caught on a slightly curved stick about four feet in length. Fastened to this stick was a piece of stout fishing line about three to four feet in length, carrying a piece of red-coloured wood - usually cedar - about five to six inches in length. A bent nail was secured to this piece of wood in the form of a hook but no bait was used. When a school of Barracouta was found the Couta stick, or paw, was brought out ready for fishing. From the cockpit of the launch the piece of wood with the nail was violently swirled with a circular motion in and out of the water, causing a disturbance of the water in a good imitation of a number of Sprats, Pilchards or other small fish jumping in and out of the sea. The Barracouta would swim for such a place. Seeing the piece of red wood moving rapidly through the water they would take it for a fish, snap at it or even jump out of the water for the lure and were caught by the crude iron hook. As the fish was hooked during the time the paw was being drawn through the water the fisherman would swing the fish over his head above the boat or launch and when the caught fish was midway in the air, more or less above the cockpit, would expertly give the stick a dexterous smart twist. As there was no barb on the hook the fish was released and fell into the cockpit.

Quote: [<i>Ibid</i> 311] Should there be any Barracouta about the... Couta sticks were then set to work to paw the water and attract Barracouta to the spot. [<i>I bid.</i>314] The Maori also knew he could catch Barracouta without bait and he, too, used a short piece of stick and line with a baitless hook and leaned over his canoe and threshed the water to and fro, which is known as `Kaihau manga!' When the European fisherman called his fishing outfit [315] `paw', the Maori uses the term `pa'. This fish was a great favourite with them and was caught in large numbers. On returning to the shore, the women cleaned the fish and then hung them up on racks to dry in the sun. Old Maoris of Opotiki told me they used a chip of Tawhai (<i>Nothofagus fusca</i>), which is dark red, in the making of a pa (paw).

It now reads "from March 2 this year a person contracted, employed, paid or otherwise engaged by a competitor, may not be engaged by another competitor." The change was quickly dubbed the "Coutts Clause" and means Coutts, one of the most effective America's Cup skippers in history, is probably out of the preparation for the 2007 challenge in Valencia.

Quote: Even if no other cattle were on the run, it behoved the station to keep a cow or two for milking purposes, and generally a lad was kept whose duties were to tend and milk the animals, and perhaps to assist in the garden. This lad was called the cowboy, and this was no abuse of the meaning of the term, whereas the American cowboy might have long grey whiskers and have never milked a cow in his life.

Quote: We went down a spur for two miles that was very soft from the late rain, and full of waterholes, called crab-holes. These holes were formed by the large snowgrass tussocks being burnt out roots and all, leaving a hole, or by the uprooting of trees, where the hole was very large ... In some places these holes made by(?) cattle mustering a most hazardous undertaking. In Mr Alex Garvie's report in 1858 he refers to `podge holes,' presumably a variety of `crab-holes.'

Quote: Like a child's cradle, [a miner's cradle] had two rockers fastened to its base, and it was rocked rather more violently. But internally the resemblance ended. It was, broadly speaking, an open box with the sides sloping inwards towards the base, and the bottom board extended about a foot beyond the end; while the end board, which formed one of the sides, did not reach to the bottom, but left an aperture. The box was fitted on top with an iron hopper punched full of quarter-inch holes and with sides about three inches high. It was into this hopper that the gold-bearing gravel was thrown, a shovelful at a time.

Quote: It took two men to work the cradle satisfactorily - one to shovel and one to rock it violently by means of a handle that was fastened up the back end of the contraption, and at the same time to dash water on to it by means of a dipper fastened to a stick. The cradle was always placed, of course, at the water's edge, and the stones that did not fall through the hopper were tipped out the front end, which was left without any retaining side. The material which was washed through the holes, and which contained the gold, fell straight down on to a sloping wooden table covered with a coarse piece of matting on which the gold was saved. The table was fitted firmly against the back and sides of the box, but stopped short about an inch from the front end to allow the tailings and what gold was not saved to fall on to another table - this one fitting firmly to the front end and the sides, and sloping dowm towards the back end. From there the tailings fell on to the back end of the bottom board, which was generally covered with coconut matting to catch any gold that might have gone all the distance, and followed along the bottom and out over the lip. By this means the wash had to travel a surprisingly long distance, and was also shaken from side to side of the cradle, so that there little chance if it was worked properly of losing any gold.

These vernacular names are given by fishermen on account of the fish benumbing or paralysing the person who unwittingly grasps one with his hands. The last name is from the somewhat similar shape to that of a skate or ray, ray being another common term for skates and also the scientific family name.

Quote: Perhaps the most intriguing game of this nature [sc. tormenting insects or animals] is `Spang Weazling'. This game was played at Denniston in 1930-35. A crawley was placed on the end of a stick the middle section of which lay balanced over a stone. Before the crawley could crawl off the stick a stone had to be thrown onto the other end of the stick so as to catapult the crawley off the stick and over the cliff. A variation of the same game was being played at Denniston when I visited there in 1949. It was called alternatively `Hit the Crawley' or `Strike the Crayfish'. In this version the other end of the stick was hit with a batting stick (as in Tip Cat) and when the crawley was catapultedinto the air it was hit again with the bat.

Quote: The term driving generally referred to tunnelling in any direction but in some circumstances, where reefs were present, it meant tunnelling along the line of the reef or parallel to it. The term drifting was used more specifically for driving on a reef, while the term crosscutting referred to tunnelling across the reef up to an angle of say forty-five degrees; however it was common to talk of `driving a crosscut'. <i>Ibid.</i> 317 <i>Crosscut</i>: A tunnel cutting across the reef system. As the shafts were sunk to new levels a main crosscut was put out from the shaft chamber on each level to cut the reefs approximately at right-angles, after which driving in both directions usually started on the first reef, while crosscutting continued until the farthest reef was opened up. It was usually necessary to make a [318] connection with the level above, near the end of the crosscut, for ventilation.

He's told us about being at a Maori gathering when a pakeha said unthinkingly, `He's as cunning as a Maori dog'. It appeared to have gone unnoticed until a Maori remarked, `He's as cunning as a pakeha dog.' Mr K enjoyed that.

In this game the cat [a thin 6-inch stick with pointed ends] was sometimes called the Cunning Joe stick (Waikouaiti, Otago, 1900) or the kip (Dunedin, 1895). It was a game for four players. Two rings were marked on the ground a short distance from each other with a square drawn in the middle of each. A boy armed with a short stick stood at each ring, a bowler behind him. One of the bowlers tossed a short piece of wood at the ring opposite. The striker hit it as hard as he could, then both boys ran as in cricket.

Quote: The most pervasive customary right was customary title, which, though unique, almost equated to ownership. It was territorial and the hapu could not have existed without the full use of the land in question. To prove a customary title, a hapu had to show it was in exclusive occupation of the land prior to sovereignty passing and that it had continued to follow customary activities on it ever since.

Quote: What is customary title? Much like an ordinary title to land, customary title confers rights to the holder. These could include the right to use the land for farming or living on. However, customary title arises where the Maori holds land in accordance with tikanga Maori or Maori custom. It is held communally (as opposed to owned) and cannot be alienated (sold or mortgaged) to anyone but the crown.

Quote: (1) Castrate. <i>Cutting and tailing</i> was the old term for earmarking, castrating and taking the tails off lambs, all of which operations are performed together. <i>Cutting and tailing</i> is still the general name mostly used by shepherds, but owing to more ladies living up country, I suppose [(probably because more women now live up country], is being replaced by <i>tailing</i> or <i>marking. </i>
