## chain-rack

n. twitch (@v and @n).
> R. Gilberd (milling Okaihau, Northland) The old method of tightening the chain securing logs to trucks is called `twitching' or `taking a twitch.' First the chain is fastened leaving it quite slack. A lever is passed through the bight and used to twist the slack up on itself. When chain is tight enough the end of the lever is tied to the chain. A `chain-rack' is now used - a giant Hayes wire-strainer. It is sometimes, but improperly, called a `twitch.' `Twitch' is probably an amalgamation of `twist' and `pitch.'

## copper Maori

n. Copper Maori seems to have been used by Europeans in the North Island (esp. Northland) for the more usual hangi, umu. with <i>copper</i>. The Maori suffix (variously spelt in early texts) is curious. (1) It is used both with its flexionless Maori pl and its anglicised pl in -s. (2) If it is an aj, the placement after the noun follows Maori grammatical usage: a fuller anglicisation would be <i>Maori copper</i>, occas. used. (3) Williams (p?) states that <i>Maori aj and n `native, belonging to New Zealand' is a comparatively recent use not recorded before 1850, and probably first used by Maoris themselves. Is this an early Maori use of the modern sense of Maori? Or an early Pakeha use? (4) Or is it a use of the sense `normal, usual, ordinary' <i>- kopa Maori</i> being the usual earth-oven, perhaps distinct from the iron tripot etc., (then called in English `copper'), the <i>*kopa Pakeha; </i>(See hangi, umu)

## copper stick

n. a stick for moving clothes when washing them in the boiling water of a copper
> Ian Douglas (51 Liverpool St, Wanganui; dougie@xtra.co.nz) says the term used in England 60 years ago was "poss stick" a long wooden stick. "There was also a 'posser' which was a pole with a sort of vacuum creating hood on the end which was used to dump or dunk the clothes up and down and help shift the dirt." John Mihaljevic (jmjm@ihug.co.nz) writes that a BBC World Service My Century documentary (The Invention that Feed Women) broadcast by Radio NZ has a woman born in the East End of London in 1927 describing washdays (presumably the 1930s) and referring to her mother's use of copper sticks. "This was not just any piece of wood, but a specific tool; she described it as a 'one-handled rolling pin'" Alan Burnett (aged 75) writes (2/10/1999) that when he was a child in Scotland "we always spoke of the copper-stick or SPURKLE which was made by cutting a broom-handle in half! and used for poking the boiling clothes.
