The latest citation (1878) reads "another kind of base is frequent in which a bead is subsituted for the scotia". <i>Casement</i> in turn is defined in the relevant sense as "a hollow moulding, a cavetto, not exceding one quarter round". <i>Cavettos</i>, it appears, are "principally used in cornices". All this is a bit obscure, but the definitions in NSOD etc would suggest a fairly uncommon word. The ordinary NZ use is specialised though common, and familar to most homeowners - a (usually concave) moulding between a wall and a ceiling. In NZ, it is standard and as well-known as <i>skirting board</i>.]

But the senses also parallel those of words with similar meanings: to wipe (off) (a person or thing), get wiped; wash out (sthg), a wash-out; to write off (sbdy or sthg), a write-off. The word seems noticeable after WW2, so perhaps it was popularised by NZ servicemen who may have picked it up from British Servicemen (or Australians): cf P.4. The connotation of contempt may have derived in part by association with SCRUB n and aj `poor, mean' etc, scrubby etc; and the particular uses of this in Australasia: scrub-bull; scrubber, scrub along.]]

## sick

 <i>adj.</i>

 <i>adj.</i>

 <i>adj.</i> NZ colloquial usage follows US and earlier British usage in assigning a main sense of `ill, unwell, ailing' to this word, esp. in the phrase <i>be sick </i>; contrast modern British usage with main sense `vomit'. That is, NZ usage follows OED a. I 1. Suffering from illness of any kind; ill, unwell, ailing. Now chiefly literary and U.S. [9-19c]. rather than 2. Having an inclination to vomit, or being actually in the condition of vomiting [18-20c]. An ambiguous statement, e.g., `I was sick on Thursday' would usually be interpreted in NZ as `I was ill' etc; in Britain probably as `I vomited etc' (Dr. R. Savage); and this can lead to some immediately horrifying images for Englishmen in N.Z., needing quick reshuffling to extract the correct sense: e.g., I was sick in bed last Thursday. Unambiguous statements naturally assign themselves appropriate senses, mainly on aspectual grounds: I was sick twice before breakfast; I have been sick for months. `Ill' is often used in NZ by, e.g. mothers and nurses, as a euphemism for the `vomit' sense: Little Tommy has just been ill all over his shoes. (When used as a verb, sick is always `vomit': N.Coghill and C. Tolkien have an interesting note to l.71 of their edition of Chaucer's <i>The Nun's Priest's Tale </i> (Harrap pp 94-5). l. 71 Repleccioun [overeating] re made hire nevere sick `sick': `ill', not `sick'. The withering away of the old sense of sick is relatively recent, and has not taken place in America; cf also <i>sickbay, sickroom, a sick man,</i> etc. Chaucer knew the word <i>ill, but for him it was a word characteristic of the North and East of England (it was of Scandinavian origin), and he only used it to give an impression of dialect in the talk of John and Aleyn, the Two Cambridge students from the North of England in the Reeve's Tale; for them, in any case, it meant `bad, evil'. Chaucer's word for being sick (in our sense) was <i>spew</i>.'

She was in the Wellington Ballet Company in 1926 and on news of Pavlova's tour wrote to her manager enquiring how they could help make her tour and reception more pleasant, her favourite colours, foods, etc. She expressed a great liking for meringue (cakes) so they consulted a chef who produced 3 attempts (e.g. a square cake was rejected in favour of a round one); finally the `soft-centre' variety was chosen. In her honour they named it Pavlova (?cake) and they presented this to Pavlova (? at a gathering) and she liked it a great deal. D. Macken is to research this - ?
