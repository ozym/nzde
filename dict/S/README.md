If a player's `taw' touched a marble and lay alongside it, the others would shout `knuckle down' just before his turn. ... `Knuckle down' meant that the player had to hold his taw close to the marble attacked and fire it in that very inconvenient position. ... When a boy lost all his marbles at play he was `scat' [?related to skint ?HWO] . ... A `ringer' was a taw which, when fired at the commencement of the game, lodged in the track of the ring itself; that, and knocking a marble out when he `fired' were the perfect shots. ... To fire a shot while holding the hand nearer to the ring than where the taw had lain, was to `funk', an unforgiveable crime. (Folkgames of Children,175)

## schnapper

>  <b>1981</b> <i>WILSON</i> SNAPPER ... The common name `snapper' was given to the fish by Captain Cook in 1770. He mistook it for a member of the true snapper family <i>Lutjanidae </i>, a group of fish with which he had become familar in American waters. Although he did mistake the fish Captain Cook spelt the name correctly, whereas many subsequent writers have used `schnapper' - an erroneous spelling of unknown origin. Perhaps some of the early snapper fishermen took bottles of schnapps along on their outings, hence going `schnapping'! (Fisherman's Bible,226)

>  <b>Mar 5, 1956</b> Bellamy's menu has qualified as the most snobbish of all State papers. Whenever the well-known New Zealand fish called snapper is an item of Parliamentary diet it is invariable [sic] spelled `schnapper.' The gourmets of the Food and Wine Society could be forgiven for such literary heresy, but the old prosaic spelling should be good enough for the dining-room in Parliament House. Incidentally, the legend is that the fish was given the name `snapper' by Captain Cook when he was here on his voyage of exploration in 1770. As he and the members of his crew leaned over the side of their galleon two centuries ago and threw their fishing lines into the waters off the New Zealand coast the fish used to snap at the bait. Hence the name snapper. (Dominion,8)

>  <b>Mar 12, 1956</b> My reference in last week's column to the snobbishness of Bellamy's in using the spelling `schnapper' when that fish was on its menu has brought `bites' galore - from fish merchants to schoolmasters. Most of them, it is fair to say, have taken up the cudgels on behalf of Bellamy's, but none of them has disproved my argument that the correct spelling is `snapper.' ... Some historians support my Captain Cook theory, though there are others who place the first use of the name `snapper' at a later date, certainly not earlier. They think the name may have been given the fish by Captain W. L. Edwardson, the commander of a New South Wales Government cutter called the Snapper which was in New Zealand waters in 1822 and 1823 investigating sealing prospects. He gave the name Port Snapper to an inlet on Ruapuke Island in Foveaux Strait. Whatever the origin of the word, the fish served at Bellamy's is indigenous to New Zealand and is spelt `snapper.' (Dominion,8)

## scotia
 
 <i>n.</i> a (usually concave) moulding between a wall and a ceiling. [Jim Cameron writes: NSOD, Collins and Chambers define <i>scotia</i> as a concave/hollow moulding, esp. at the base of an (ionic) column. The OED definition is "a hollow moulding = casement". The latest citation (1878) reads "another kind of base is frequent in which a bead is subsituted for the scotia". <i>Casement</i> in turn is defined in the relevant sense as "a hollow moulding, a cavetto, not exceding one quarter round". <i>Cavettos</i>, it appears, are "principally used in cornices". All this is a bit obscure, but the definitions in NSOD etc would suggest a fairly uncommon word. The ordinary NZ use is specialised though common, and familar to most homeowners - a (usually concave) moulding between a wall and a ceiling. In NZ, it is standard and as well-known as <i>skirting board</i>.]

The word seems noticeable after WW2, so perhaps it was popularised by NZ servicemen who may have picked it up from British Servicemen (or Australians): cf P.4.

>  <b>1956</b> <i>GRAHAM</i> SEAPERCH (POHUIAKAROA) JOCK STUART, HIGHLANDER, FIVEFINGER, SOLDIERFISH or SCRODDIE <i>Helicolenus papillosus</i> (Bloch and Schneider) The seaperch is a fish well known to all fishermen both sports and commercial fishermen alike, who give it quite a number of vernacular names, a few of which are as follows: Jock Stuart, Highlander, Fivefinger and Soldierfish. These names have a bearing on some distinguishing characteristic of the fish. For instance the first two names are supposed to be given on account of the colouring of the fish resembling, in some ways, the tartan of a Scot; while Fivefingers is given on account of the so-called five (really more) fingers (rays) of the pectoral fins, on which the fish has a habit of resting on the floor of the aquarium tank. The name Soldierfish is derived from the similarities of this fish to the activities of a soldier or picket on sentinel duty. I have often seen Seaperch stand or, rather, rest at attention on its pectoral fins for lengthy periods. When it did move, it moved to the right or to the left with the precision of a well-trained soldier. The name Scroddie, commonly used at the northern end of the South Island, is derived from the word Scrod which means a young Dogfish. It appears from my researches that when the early colonists first saw a small Seaperch they at once named it Scrod and later the `ie' was tacked on to make Scroddie.

## seal's ballast
 
 <i>n.</i>

>  <b>1871</b> Anyone who had ever been about old whaling and sealing stations must have seen collections of round smooth stones of various sizes but mostly about the size of cannon-balls, lying on the beach. On asking any of the `old hands' what these are, you will at once be told that they are `seal's ballast' ... You will probably be gravely told that the seal is a migratory animal, and that when it is about to take a long journey it will trim itself to exactly the proper weight for long and easy locomotion through the water. It picks up one of these stones and swallows it and goes into the water to try the effect. If it finds it requires more ballast it comes ashore again and repeats the dose. If it has too much weight .... it vomits one or two of the stones out on the beach. Hence the stones are always termed `seals' ballast' (TrNZI,4/417) [NOTES: (Otago)]

>  <b>Nov 25, 1948</b> <i>WALL</i> Who first called these immigrants by this opprobrious name is not stated, but it seems to me most probable that the Pilgrims used it as a term of contempt, and [110] that the immigrants took it to themselves much as the `Old Contemptibles' ... adopted their enemies' names in a spirit of defiance. ... There arises the further question as to the origin of the word which ... has been explained as an Irish `shaughraun'. Now why should an Irish word have been used at that time by the English settlers in Canterbury? ... My belief is that the word was not originally `Shagroon' but `Shabroon', `shabberoon', `shabbaroon' (all spellings occur) which is on record from the 18th century onwards, meaning `a mean, shabby fellow', `a disreputable or mean-spirited fellow', and this, which would be probably familiar to the English Pilgrims, is just the sort of term which would naturally be used to describe their rivals. This `shabroon' derives from the slang `shab', a low fellow, recorded as early as 1637, and no doubt closely alied to the standard `shabby', and ultimately from `shab' and `scab', two forms of the old English word. ... I conjecture that the `shabroon' [?does Wall mean `shagroon] of the English Pilgrims was by some pronounced with the `b' and by others with the `g', nobody ever having seen the word written or printed.

One of the vistiors, who seem to have delighted in the soubriquet of `Shagroon', ventured to prophesy, in a letter, which found its way into print, that the `Canterbury Pilgrims' would soon be ruined and their country left for occupation by his more enlightened comrades. The `pilgrims' sought no harsher revenge than to nickname their Port Philip visitors `prophets' and to take example from their experience in pastoral pursuits. The Canterbury pasturage system was quickly adapted to the requirements of sheepfarming on a large scale, and `pilgrims' and `prophets' were soon merged into one class of Canterbury runholders.]

This was carried out principally by stock owners from Australia, who, to distinguish them from the Pilgrims or those who came from England direct to Canterbury, were called Shagroons. What this title is derived from is not quite clear. An amusing piece ... respecting the climate of New Zealand, and particularly Canterbury, was published about this time, and as it shews what opinion our Australian visitors held of our vaunted New Zealand climate, perhaps to reproduce it would be interesting. ... our Australian bard, under the title of `The Shagroon's Lament,' discourses as follows:- (Stray Leaves,10)

In general, sharemilkers fall into three categories: first, the 29 per cent sharemilker, second, the 39 per cent man, third, the 50 per cent man. The 29 per cent man contracts to milk the farmer's herd and attend to their wants only; he helps at haymaking, etc. as part of the herd's `wants', but in general, once the cows have been attended to for the two daily milkings, his time is his own. The 39 per cent man contracts to milk the herd owned by the farmer and to do all the other general farm work. For this he receives 39 per cent of the herd profits. The 50 per cent sharemilker runs his own herd of cows on another man's land. He does all the farm work, and receives 50 per cent of the profits. Many farmers who today have their own farms in New Zealand started off as 39 per cent share milkers, saved enough to buy their own herds and so became 50 per cent milkers, then saved again to purchase land themselves (or on which they put sharemilkers!) (In the Sticks,183)

If, on the other hand, he had done the job to the best of his ability but he was not satisfied with the job, he used the phrase `She's not too good' or `She's pretty poor' Never was the phrase `She's right' used in the sense that politicians and various other people not in the know use it to refer to a job badly done or done with a `couldn't-care-less' attitude. This was never necessary because in the Army we had other phrases to cover such contingencies when things did not go according to plan, such as NAFU and SAFU, the first being a non-adjusting fiasco, and the second being a self-adjusting fiasco.

>  <b>1939</b> <i>BEATTIE</i> The custom in the old days was to call the buildings on a run `the station,' and the land that went with it was `the run.' On a big property you could find several `stations,' and the principal one was called `the home station,' while the others were `out-stations.' This was the old Australian usage which was carried over to New Zealand at first, but gradually the signification was altered by loosely calling the whole run a station, and then the real station became a homestead and the out-stations became shepherds' huts. In this present book it will be noticed that generally the writer has preserved the olden custom of calling the main buildings the station and the land the run. The runs over in Australia being, as a rule, much larger than those in New Zealand, the `station' and `out-station' phraseology was preserved much longer than over here, where even in advertisements in the late 'fifties we see the English word `homestead' ousting the colonial word `station.' <i>Ibid.</i> 12 . provisions became `rations' ... when served out to the man at the `shepherds' huts' (or out-stations).

>  <b>1910</b> <i>MACDONALD</i> I do not know exactly how wholesale mercantile business was carried on, but the retail business in the town [?Wellington] was carried on [c1840s] mostly by means of little bits of printed paper, issued by shopkeepers, for from one penny to two or three shillings. This currency went by the general name of `shin plaster'. <i>Ibid.</i> 117 When eggs fell from six silver shillings per dozen to one shilling of `shin plasters', the Hutt, Porirua Road and Karori settlers looked anxious. (Reminiscences,109) [NOTES: c1840s in c1910 Macdonald Reminiscences (TS:VUW) 109]

>  <b>1941</b> <i>SUTHERLAND</i> <i>Shinplasters</i>.- The fact that private traders found it necessary themselves, to issue paper notes in denominations below five shillings suggests that at the outset ... the Fitzroy notes were not issued for values below five shillings. The private paper notes were issued for small change, redeemable mostly in `Five Shillings, in Government debentures.' Both the debentures and the private notes were issued on poor paper, and soon became known as `Government Rags' and `Shinplasters' respectively. The term `Shinplaster' for paper money appears to have come to New Zealand from America, via New South Wales. *[fn] In the latter Colony the issue of paper money of a denomination lower than twenty shillings was prohibited in 1826 to promote the circulation of sterling instead of a colonial currency, and the prohibition was welcomed by the people as `preventing the Colony being inundated with beggarly rags' and dollar and half-dollar notes `used often as a paltry contrivance to evade payment of debt,' <i>vide "The Australian," </i>19 July 1826. [fn] Various reasons have been given for the origin of this curious term for paper money issued in the forties. The most likely explanation comes from America (p. 650 <i>The Numismatist,</i> 1938), where it is stated that in the good old days post-boys and out-riders, wearing high boots, were required, at times, to pay toll-fees at toll-gates, and in order to facilitate progress they placed paper money or coins in bags in their boot-tops, against their shins - hence the term `shin-plaster.' (Numismatic History of NZ,158)

>  <b>1972</b> <i>HARGREAVES</i> The [Governor Fitzroy's (1844)] Debentures, popularly known as `government rags', were given various nicknames such as<i> assignats,</i> `shinplasters', and `flash notes'. All these terms had reference to worthless paper money, some of which had been issued in the past. <i>Assignats</i> was the name given to large amounts of paper money issued in France during the French Revolution, but which depreciated to such as extent to be almost worthless. `Shinplasters' - sometimes written `skinplasters' - had its origin in North America, and again referred to depreciated paper money, while `flash notes' was a popular term in use for any counterfeit money or worthless forged paper money.

 <i>adj.</i> NZ colloquial usage follows US and earlier British usage in assigning a main sense of `ill, unwell, ailing' to this word, esp. in the phrase <i>be sick </i>; contrast modern British usage with main sense `vomit'. That is, NZ usage follows OED a. I 1. Suffering from illness of any kind; ill, unwell, ailing. Now chiefly literary and U.S. [9-19c]. rather than 2. Having an inclination to vomit, or being actually in the condition of vomiting [18-20c]. An ambiguous statement, e.g., `I was sick on Thursday' would usually be interpreted in NZ as `I was ill' etc; in Britain probably as `I vomited etc' (Dr. R. Savage); and this can lead to some immediately horrifying images for Englishmen in N.Z., needing quick reshuffling to extract the correct sense: e.g., I was sick in bed last Thursday. Unambiguous statements naturally assign themselves appropriate senses, mainly on aspectual grounds: I was sick twice before breakfast; I have been sick for months. `Ill' is often used in NZ by, e.g. mothers and nurses, as a euphemism for the `vomit' sense: Little Tommy has just been ill all over his shoes. (When used as a verb, sick is always `vomit': N.Coghill and C. Tolkien have an interesting note to l.71 of their edition of Chaucer's <i>The Nun's Priest's Tale </i> (Harrap pp 94-5). l. 71 Repleccioun [overeating] re made hire nevere sick `sick': `ill', not `sick'. The withering away of the old sense of sick is relatively recent, and has not taken place in America; cf also <i>sickbay, sickroom, a sick man,</i> etc. Chaucer knew the word <i>ill, but for him it was a word characteristic of the North and East of England (it was of Scandinavian origin), and he only used it to give an impression of dialect in the talk of John and Aleyn, the Two Cambridge students from the North of England in the Reeve's Tale; for them, in any case, it meant `bad, evil'. Chaucer's word for being sick (in our sense) was <i>spew</i>.'

 <i>v.</i> to negotiable a steep slope of a hill by going round the side of it rather than straight up to the crest. (probably a back form from SIDELING.)

>  <b>Sep 1958</b> To <i>sidle </i>, to go around the side or across the face of a hill, is a characteristic New Zealand expression, strange to the Englishman or Australian. The example of 1821 in O.E.D.: `Ye know the footpath sidles down the hill', suggests that something of the New Zealand meaning was not unknown in England, but it cannot have been well known, or mountaineers would not have started to use <i>traverse </i>, both as a noun and as a verb, towards the end of last century. <i>Sidle </i> is well known among high-country musterers. As it is a word most likely to be used in open hilly or mountainous country, one may guess that musterers and up-country people gave it currency, whence it was adopted by mountain club people. If ski-ing had not brought its more or less international vocabulary with it we should no doubt be sidling slopes, on skis, that we now traverse... From 1936 to 1938 in <i>The Tramper </i> there are a number of references to `sidling tracks' and `sidling routes'. Towards the end of 1938 comes `after sidling round the head of the said stream', and, a year later, `we sidle the top of Three Johns', and from then on the verb flourishes. In 1940 comes `on a long sidle', and from then on the noun is as common as the verb. <i>Ibid.</i> 41 From the top basin we sidled up tiresome scree, ... and at last emerged on the top of the divide. (Tararua,29) [NOTES: Ruth Mason `Track and Trail']

(Daily Southern Cross,3)

>  <b>Jun 2, 1855</b> A few blows with the tomahawk, a fire-stick judiciously employed, and, should the brook be high, a little sidling over a low bank or two, is the most that can be needed, though the gorge being very narrow, its aspect may at first appear discouraging for a mile or two. (Nelson Examiner and New Zealand Chronicle,2)

They differ from a group he calls "lifestylers" - a term derived from the ubiquitous "life style block" dreamed up by real-estate agents when they began to sell the concept of country living 20 years ago.

In the Dee is laid a `strop', a short length of cable with an eye in each end. The eyes are connected with each other and to a short chain by a shackle; and the chain is attached to `the rope' with a hitch. (Personal Communication)

## snow-apple
 
 <i>n.</i> [Kolstad says these are species of <i>Gaultheria</i> and snow-apple in this sense does not appear to occur elsewhere, only in OED2 and US Dictionaries as an apple cultivar.

 <i>n.</i>

>  <b>1953</b> Perhaps the most intriguing game of this nature [sc. tormenting insects or animals] is `Spang Weazling'. This game was played at Denniston in 1930-35. A crawley was placed on the end of a stick the middle section of which lay balanced over a stone. Before the crawley could crawl off the stick a stone had to be thrown onto the other end of the stick so as to catapult the crawley off the stick and over the cliff. A variation of the same game was being played at Denniston when I visited there in 1949. It was called alternatively `Hit the Crawley' or `Strike the Crayfish'. In this version the other end of the stick was hit with a batting stick (as in Tip Cat) and when the crawley was catapulted into the air it was hit again with the bat. (Unorganized Games,1/406)

It has been used in both these senses in Australia (whence the word came) since the 'thirties. ([1898 Morris Austral-English]) (1) The original sense is still preserved up country, where the men always speak of <i>in at the s</i>., when they are out on the run; also in the word <i>out-s</i>. (q.v.), which has no other meaning than the house, yards etc. (2) The secondary sense of a property with freehold, leasehold, buildings, and stock.

(4) Adjective as in s.horse, belonging to the owner, not to one of the man, whose horses are<i> private; s. sheep</i>, not one belonging to a neighbour; <i>s.-bred,</i> not a bought sheep. (5) Since the 1890s, auctioneers in their advertisements have taken to speaking of <i>s. lines</i> of sheep, though 70 per cent. of those so designated at the autumn ewe fairs come from farms or grazing runs. ([1898 Morris Austral-English]) (Press, The,21) [NOTES: Acland Glossary]

>  <b>1947</b> <i>BEATTIE</i> The custom in the old days was to call the buildings on a run `the station,' and the land that went with it was `the run.' On a big property you could find several `stations,' and the principal one was called `the home station,' while the others were `out-stations.' This was the old Australian usage which was carried over to New Zealand at first, but gradually the signification was altered by loosely calling the whole run a station, and then the real station became a homestead and the out-stations became shepherds' huts. In this present book it will be noticed that generally the writer has preserved the olden custom of calling the main buildings the station and the land the run. The runs over in Australia being, as a rule, much larger than those in New Zealand, the `station' and `out-station' phraseology was preserved much longer than over here, where even in advertisements in the late `fifties we see the English word `homestead' ousting the colonial word `station.' (Early Runholding in Otago,11)

>  <b>Jul 21, 1856</b> It is usually understood that in the early days the word `station' denoted the owner's house and its immediate buildings, while `run' meant the whole property. Strange to say, I only noted the word `station' twice, and each time with a diverse meaning. On July 21, 1865, the diary says: `Sold 17 head of cattle - remaining on station 15 head.' Then on September 11, 1865, we read: `Wilkinson returned to the Home Station.' The first of these entries means the whole run - the second the homestead or main buildings.

[249] So far as I could discriminate, swaggers (those who, snail-like, carry their worldly possessions on their backs) are men occasionally willing to do a day's work for a night's lodging and a couple of meals. Sundowners (those who have no possessions to carry) walk from station to station during the day, and, sleeping under a haystack until sunset, make their appearance at that hour before the `whares' or huts provided for them, and demand from the owners supper and shelter, which are generally granted.

The `sun-downer' is one who tramps from place to place pretending to seek employment, but, as a matter of fact living upon the supper and breakfast with which he is supplied at most up-country stations. He fears to arrive too early in the day, lest he should be requested to seek a bed elsewhere, and hence the name with which he has been endowed. (New Zealand Of Today,181)

>  <b>1873</b> <i>PYKE</i> Now, a `sundowner' or `tussocker' for the terms are synonymous - is a pastoral loafer; one who loiters about till dusk, and then makes for the nearest station or hut, to beg for shelter and food. (Wild Will Enderby,Bk III ch x 105) [NOTES: (1889)]

These black layers are often one or two inches thick, and repose upon coarse quartzose sands. As soon as a storm has subsided, the `beachers' or `surfers' as they are called, examine the coastline near their houses. When they come upon one of the rich spots, the fine particles of gold being often visible to the naked eye, they at once remove the black layer of sand out of the reach of the tide, and wash it when convenient.
