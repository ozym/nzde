Quote: Although many runholders came to regard the land they leased as their own, their occupancy was intended to be only a temporary using of waste land until it was required for closer settlement. Anyone - the runholder included - could buy the freehold of all or any part of a run at any time to establish a farm. However, some protection for runholders was essential, for they could not be expected to improve their runs if the land and improvements were in danger of being freeholded without warning by an outside buyer. Runholders were able to register with the Provincial Council improvements such as buildings, plantations, fencing, and yards, for which they were granted [246] an improvement pre-emptive right (i.P.R.) covering fifty acres of land surrounding the improvement. A homestead pre-emptive right (H.P.R.), which afforded protection for 250 acres, could also be registered. ... One H.P.R. could be taken out for each property and it was only businesslike that each runholder should use this right to secure 250 acres around his homestead against purchase by an outsider. An H.P.R. was initially intended to cover the owner's or manager's home, but, in the case of runs of over 5,000 acres, could be extended to cover an outstation.

Quote: The term `hack' as understood in this country is not at all to be conflicted with the same term as applied elsewhere to horse racing under that category. A hack in New Zealand is a horse that has not won a certain amount of moneys [sic], and so it is quite possible for the Derby favorite of the year, or the New Zealand Cup favorite to be a hack.

Quote: Sheep dog.- Dog to work sheep; collie (q.v.). S.ds. run naturally either to bring sheep towards you or to drive them away; and when a puppy shows his preference he is broken in for that work. The dogs that bring sheep are called heading ds. (q.v.) and most of these can be taught to lead (q.v.) if desired. Dogs which take to driving sheep away are broken in to huntaway and are called htwys (q.v.). Some dogs will both hd. and htwy and are called handy ds. They are not generally high-class heading dogs but very useful about hand and sometimes very useful mustering dogs. Some men have a special slewing d., but a well-trained, hdg. dog or htwy. will usually slew (q.v.). (C.)

Now at that time spirits were very hard to come by, but Paul Rabone, the proprietor of the Mangatara Hotel, seemed to have an inexhaustible supply. Doing as he was bid the barman proceeded from one end to the other, putting in such things as scotch, gin, bacardi, rum, creme de menthe, and so on.

Where the Hansards made their name was by producing their reports more quickly than their competitors did.

There are always a few of these unsocial miners about every digging, and their solitariness arises from every imaginable cause. Frequently they are misanthropes, sometimes placid contented creatures, who, so long as they can make a living by `fossicking' about, are happy. / [139].

Quote: HATTER: a solitary, a digger who works alone. The derivation of this New Zealand expression is obscure. Archdeacon Harper described the hatters as `men who live and work by themselves, often old sailors and much travelled men, content with the solitude of well-kept huts, a few books, hard work, their dog as companion, perhaps some poultry, and a weekly visit on Saturdays to the townships to sell their gold and see friends. Whence the term `hatter' i have never discovered; maybe because such solitaries are regarded as `mad as a hatter'. Another possibility is suggested by the remark that the hatter `kept his whole world under his hat'.

The yard was divided into three - one large and two small - but as there was no crush pen, or drafting race, we had to head rope those requiring branding, and after hauling them up to a corner post, leg-roped and threw them on [44] their side, placing a long lever on their neck and under the lowest rail so that they would not move much ... When released the poor beast is not in an amiable temper ... So anyone in the yard has to climb the rails quickly ..., and the idea that it may catch you before your legs are safely over the cap rail certainly accelerates one's movements.

Quote: Heading. in the long head the competitor stands with his dog in a ring (1 chain in diameter) facing a hillside near the top of which three sheep are set loose. When time is called the dog is dispatched, either on a left-hand or a right-hand cast, up the hill for some 800 yards to a point behind the sheep. On command the dog `lifts' the sheep and, keeping them together, `pulls' them in a direct line back to his master in the ring. To allow the dog to show complete control over the sheep, the run ends with a `hold in the ring'. This involves stopping the sheep in the ring and holding them there. The first stages of the short head are much the same, but over half the distance, 400 yards. At the point where the sheep reach the shepherd, man and dog must drive them ahead down a `drive' which is 60 yards long and 1 chain wide and defined by short poles, to a set of hurdles which are 9 ft apart and parallel with the line of the drive. The sheep are driven between the hurdles and then down a second drive, similar to the first, to the pen or yard, which is 6 ft square. After opening one side, the competitor must stand by the pen gate until the sheep are yarded. The dog must do virtually all the work and his master's right of movement and intervention are strictly limited.

And inside there was a model of Christ on the cross - just a tiny thing. And over the top there was a word you could hardly read but it looked like H-E-N-R-i. Well, Mr Anderson said, i could never work it out why they were called Henrys - that's what us diggers called them, little Henrys. D'you know, i've always meant to ask somebody why they were called that name. And it was on the tip of Dave's tongue to explain, but he thought no. Because he'd have to explain why the i's weren't J's, and --[note 271:] ... His explanation of `little Henry' would have been based on i.N.R.i., Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews, from Lat. iesus Nazarenus, Rex iudaeorum.

Quote: A cow with `a good test', that is, milk rich in butterfat, may be more valuable than another cow that gives more milk. About 1910 the practice rose of smpling milk from all the cows in a herd individually and testing the milk for its fat content. This process is called herd-testing. ... it is still not decided whether the word is hyphenated or not. i find it without a hyphen in a publication of the Department of Agriculture in 1950, with a hyphen in a textbook of dairying in 1955. Pronunciation is with one stress, on herd. <i>ibid.</i> 149 in New Zealand, everyone uses the term herd-testing, not milk-testing, because everyone thinks of the dairy industry from a producer's, not a consumer's, point of view.

Quote: Visitors to Wellington comment on the brisk pace of the pedestrians, and Wellington trampers have achieved a certain notoriety for the speed with which some of them travel in the hills. it is not surprising, therefore, that its hillmen and hillwomen should hiss along, that hissers and little hissers should flourish, and that little hisser should sometimes be used as a term of approbation - `stew a hisser', `a real hisser of a day'. The Tramper first gives to hiss in 1934, and hisser with reference to a stew appears on 1940, but to a person not until 1943, though it must have been so used long before.

Others began life as schools and homes and later became huts. These huts have heritage value as the only physical remnant of these activities. ...

'Things like positioning of bones and teeth, everything from the traditional farm animal breeding world, you can forget about when it comes to Hokonuis.

Baker identified the Hokitika version as based on a method of counting `whereby the person who calls a certain number in a sequence pays a specified sum into the jackpot'. Glenn Johnston defines the Hokonui version as a drinking game that combines elements of chance with the ability to hold your liquor and follow a few simple rules - though the deviousness of the caller can also influence proceedings. The aims are simple: to liven things up, get a bit of alcohol consumed quickly and sort the stayers from the pikers.

There were Little Ring, Liney, Follows, Follow the Taw, Holey, and then, on a less important scale, Butcher's Board, in which the marbles were bowled through the holes in a board, Eye-Drop, Knock-Backs, Leggings-Out (or Leggin's-Out), Span-'Em, and Backits.

Notes: Alistair Paterson, 34B Methuen Rd, Avondale (Fax.(09)8282209 says used in 1940's at the Aurora Sailing Club, Nelson, to describe a boat that's finished a race (usually successfully) and has been hauled from the water onto the hard and hosed down. It's my recollection (DEH) that the same phrase was used then also by racing commentators and it was transferred to the winner of any competitive event. Partridge ("A Dictionary of Catch Phrases") discusses "home and hosed" as an Aus. variant of "home and dried on the pig's back." He also says: "The predominantly UK and Anglo-Irish elab. is 'home and dried with the blanket on,' which 'stems from horse-racing, but . . . is used for any mission accomplished' (Skehan, 1977)."

Quote: The custom in the old days was to call the buildings on a run `the station,' and the land that went with it was `the run.' On a big property you could find several `stations,' and the principal one was called `the home station,' while the others were `out-stations.' This was the old Australian usage which was carried over to New Zealand at first, but gradually the signification was altered by loosely calling the whole run a station, and then the real station became a homestead and the out-stations became shepherds' huts. in this present book it will be noticed that generally the writer has preserved the olden custom of calling the main buildings the station and the land the run. The runs over in Australia being, as a rule, much larger than those in New Zealand, the `station' and `out-station' phraseology was preserved much longer than over here, where even in advertisements in the late 'fifties we see the English word `homestead' ousting the colonial word `station.'

Quote: it is usually understood that in the early days the word `station' denoted the owner's house and its immediate buildings, while `run' meant the whole property. Strange to say, i only noted the word `station' twice, and each time with a diverse meaning. On July 21, 1865, the diary says: `Sold 17 head of cattle - remaining on station 15 head.' Then on September 11, 1865, we read: `Wilkinson returned to the Home Station.' The first of these entries means the whole run - the second the homestead or main buildings.

That is, `My town house is a townhouse', correctly distinguishes, on the page, and will be distinguished in speech; tow stresses for the one, and one stress (TOWNhouse) for the other. There is as well a question of nuance to be noticed. A townhouse is emphatically upmarket from a home unit.

Quote: Hollywood ensured the words Home Alone were something to chuckle about. A 10-year-old's mischievous romps while left to his own devices were laughed at by millions. However, in New Zealand the phrase has a more depressing definition. "Home alone" is synonymous with the neglect of children for their welfare or the foolhardy belief "nothing can go wrong" even if mum and dad are just popping to the shops for 15 minutes.... The home-alone law has been accused of hurting children because fining parents meant there would be less money for the family.

Quote: The custom in the old days was to call the buildings on a run `the station,' and the land that went with it was `the run.' On a big property you could find several `stations,' and the principal one was called `the home station,' while the others were `out-stations.' This was the old Australian usage which was carried over to New Zealand at first, but gradually the signification was altered by loosely calling the whole run a station, and then the real station became a homestead and the out-stations became shepherds' huts. in this present book it will be noticed that generally the writer has preserved the olden custom of calling the main buildings the station and the land the run. The runs over in Australia being, as a rule, much larger than those in New Zealand, the `station' and `out-station' phraseology was preserved much longer than over here, where even in advertisements in the late 'fifties we see the English word `homestead' ousting the colonial word `station.'

Probably most of the `pilers' were beach-claims, where the leads were shallow and rich, the outlay small and provisions cheap because of easy access. <i>ibid.</i> 275 The richest claim was always a `homeward-bounder'. A Nelson digger recalled how at work his mates talked of `trips to Europe, going back for a week, and astonishing the Natives generally'. <i>ibid.</i> 329 J. F.

Notes: Hoot, is first recorded as slang from Otago in 1864. This is reasonable. In the more Maori districts the use would still have primary Maori meanings and associations, while in Otago, where there were few Maoris, the transference to purely European idiom be could completed much earlier. This transference was probably helped by rhyme with loot (cf the ? mistaken interpretation of 1845 Barnicoat Journal 163. `Our first endeavour was to get a native as a guide over the hills `How much the loot' of course was the answer to our enquiries.') though op. cit 190 `bargained for utu'); loot could have been an occasional joking word for money, although it is not attested in NZ until fairly recently but cf Partridge. Supp. Loot 3. `Scottish slang for money received on pay-day' Services: ca 1925; anglicised as hoot, money, cash.

Quote: `There are several specimens of bush slang transplanted from the Maori language. `Hoot' is a very frequent synonym for money or wage. i have heard a shearer at the Pastoralist Union office in Sydney when he sought to ascertain the scale of remuneration, enquire of the gilt-edged clerk behind the barrier, `What's the hoot, mate?' The Maori equivalent for money is utu, pronounced by the Ngapuhi and other northern tribes with the last syllable clipped, and the word is very largely used by the kauri-gum diggers and station hands in the North island. The original meaning of first settled in New Zealand, they found that the savage inhabitants had no conception of any recompense except the grim recompense of blood. Under Christianizing influences the natives were induced to forego the blood-revenge for injuries, on receiving a solatium in goods or land, and so utu came to have the double meaning of revenge and recompense, and eventually became recognized as the Maori word for money.'

Quote: A. Maori contexts. Orig. a European rendering of the Maori noun utu, return (for anything ); satisfaction, ransom, reward, price, reply' (Williams); not to be used confused with uto `revenge', a confusion evident in many of the explanations of the meaning of utu). The word widely used was in all the above senses by Europeans who had dealings with Maoris, from the general `return for work, injury, etc.' to the concrete `money' it is often found constructed with the definite article `the utu, hutu' etc. translating the original Maori indefinite article, or adjective `some' he utu `an utu, some utu'. (Occas. constr with indef. article, see 1834). in later European usage the definite article was dropped to conform to English idiom eg' `give me the hoot' becomes `give me (some) hoot' The following is perhaps a `transitional' use 1828 C Davis journal Colenso Papers 3/18) `Another chief had been killed as a utu or payment'. (is this [ei utu] reflecting Maori [(h)e utu], as well as English a for an?). The phonology, resulting in the English hoot, parallels that of toot from tutu, with the final unvoiced [u] not being heard by English ears. The initial [h] derives perhaps from a syncopation of [he utu]; but more prob. from the var. or error noted on p. 4 of 1842: Maunsell Grammar of the New Zealand Language (4th ed) 1894: `in pronouncing u, the speaker will have to guard against the error of those who prefix the aspirate when no aspirate is admissable. According to the u, utu, etc., are pronounced as if spelt hu, hutu.'.

## "Hori"


WordClass: noun

Definition: a Maori [Maori Hori[o-macron], alteration of George]. it was often used as a stage-Maori name, or as a general term of reference or address to an un-named Maori. Unlike Hongi, it was not at first so objectivable as used by English speakers (but cf the 1933 quotation). it is used by Maoris among themselves humorously or sardonically; cf George, hongi @n. (From Maori rendering of English George, formerly fairly common as a name among Maoris, esp. during reigns of Kings George iii-Vi; cf.) 1a. a particular Maori named Hori

Quote: it is often assumed that the phrase [sc. the "House of Pain"] came to be applied by visiting teams because of the perceived difficulty of winning at Carisbrook. it actually began, however, in the late 1980s within the Otago team when players referred to Carisbrook as the House of Pain, because of exhausting training sessions. it was once attributed to an Otago player of the time, Brent Pope, and he happily claimed the credit for it, but it's difficult to pin down to one person. it's only in recent years that it's been seen as the House of Pain for visiting teams - a belief encouraged by Radio Sport (which began in 1998) commentators who had little or no acquaintance with either the ground or the phrase.

More recently, the two types have merged, and today the Maori children, who are mainly responsible for perpetuating the game in New Zealand, include in their games movements borrowed from the European tradition. ... in most of the provinces the game was known as Knucklebones, and it is widely reported as having been played by New Zealand children of European origin until about 1900. Occasionally it was known as Chucks, Chuckstones, Chuckystones, Fingerstones, Hucklebones, Jacks, Jackstones, Knuckles, or Knucklestones. Children still played it here and there throughout the country in 1949, but they knew little about it until plastic knuckles were imported in 1954 in large quantities and revived the game.

Quote: An outsider might guess that our weather in the hills was almost always bad, to judge by the characteristic expressions used. The derisive phrases, `Send it down, Hughie' and `Let it come down, Hughie', go back to early in this century and are variants of the British military catch-phrase `Send it down, David'. `Send her down, Hughie', common in Australia's droughty climate, may not be so derisive. Judging by a verse attached to Dekker's Shoemaker's Holiday, St. Hugh has long been associated with rain.

Quote: The Beardie was developed as a barking dog because in some parts of Scotland, particularly in the Western Highlands, much of the ground is covered with bracken, which combined with the deep gullies known as corries, makes it impossible for a heading dog to see his sheep. Here the shepherd has to get out above the sheep and more or less chase them out of the thick cover. These dogs were known as hunters, and it is presumably an adaptation of this name which led to the designation, huntaway. At the turn of the century there were four well known strains of huntaways about North Canterbury and Marlborough - the Clown, Rag, Borderglen's Rose and Pollock's Old Clyde breeds. Of these the Clown strain certainly had Beardie blood, believed to have been started with a half Beardie brought out from Scotland.

Quote: The machine age on the gumfield appears to have been heralded as early as 1915 when an ingenious digger, whose name has unfortunately been forgotten, introduced what came to be known as the `hurdy-gurdy' or `gurdy.' ... [83] in its simplest form it was a tub, or a section of a small galvanised iron tank, the bottom perforated with small holes. in the centre stood a strong, revolving, upright shaft, to the lower part of which was attached a wooden paddle, extending on both sides of the shaft, almost to the sides of the tank. The top of the revolving shaft was fitted with a horizontal handle, enabling the paddle to be swung to and fro in a half-circle. This simple machine was usually operated by two men; a supply of gum-bearing dirt having been put into the tank, buckets of water were thrown in by one man while the other vigorously turned the shaft handle this way and that, stirring up the soil while the muddy water flowed out through the perforations.

Quote: A HiGH COURT jury was told by Crown counsel Justin Smith in Wellington yesterday of a hire purchase `hydraulic deal' - a transaction, in which a hire purchase agreement stated a deposit had been paid whereas, in fact, it had not. ... Mr Smith said that during the trial the jury would hear about what was known colloquially as a `hydraulic deal'. This was a situation where there was a deal in which a dealer intended to sell a truck for, say, $50,000 and required a deposit of $10,000 by any hire purchaser. in the case of a $50,000 truck (a hypothetical example) the dealer knew the hire purchase company was going to have reservations about financing the full $50,000. `So the dealer draws up a hire purchase agreement anyway. The real price is still $50,000. But on the agreement the dealer said he had received the sum of $10,000 by way of deposit.' Mr Smith said that if a hire purchase company accepted the assignment of the agreement the dealer got his money in full and the customer got his truck (then claimed to be worth $60,000) without having to pay a deposit.
