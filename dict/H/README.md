## H.P.R.
 
 <i>abbr.</i> homestead pre-emptive right [(hist.)]

>  <b>CRAWFORD</b> Although many runholders came to regard the land they leased as their own, their occupancy was intended to be only a temporary using of waste land until it was required for closer settlement. Anyone - the runholder included - could buy the freehold of all or any part of a run at any time to establish a farm. However, some protection for runholders was essential, for they could not be expected to improve their runs if the land and improvements were in danger of being freeholded without warning by an outside buyer. Runholders were able to register with the Provincial Council improvements such as buildings, plantations, fencing, and yards, for which they were granted [246] an improvement pre-emptive right (i.P.R.) covering fifty acres of land surrounding the improvement. A homestead pre-emptive right (H.P.R.), which afforded protection for 250 acres, could also be registered. ... One H.P.R. could be taken out for each property and it was only businesslike that each runholder should use this right to secure 250 acres around his homestead against purchase by an outsider. An H.P.R. was initially intended to cover the owner's or manager's home, but, in the case of runs of over 5,000 acres, could be extended to cover an outstation. <i>(1981,Station Years</i>) [NOTES: [ca1878]]

## hakuwai
 
 <i>n.</i> A Maori legendary bird, said to be heard at night but never seen. (Suggested originals include frigate bird, Haast's eagle; the most probable being Miskelly below, i.e. NZ snipe in display flights.) See also hokioi. [19?? Miskelly in Notornis 34 get cit]

>  Many legends are associated with the mythical bird "hokioi"... in the South and in some parts of the North island it is identical, apparently, with the "hakuwai" which has seven joints in its wing, lives in the sky, and presages trouble... "its cry was Hokioi! Hokioi! Hu!" The last word represented the whizzing sound made by the bird in flight. <i>(Sep 11, 1912,Otago Witness,76</i>)

>  <b>DEMPSEY</b> The Mysterious Ha-ka-wai Bird [heading] No-one has ever seen it, no-one knows what it is like. Mutton-birders who have heard the strange sound of its passing over the islands at night speak of the ha-ka-wai bird. A swish of wings close overhead, a sound like the rattle of chains when a boat lets the anchor down, again the sound of wingbeats and the cry floating earthward from the heavens, Ha-ka-wai! Ha-ka-wai! in a drawn-out singsong with accent on the first and last syllables. <i>(1964,Little World of Stewart island,61</i>)

>  A strange bird in Maori eyes is the hakuai of the off-shore islands in the far south. ... Whole families go mutton-birding ... At night the fowlers gather round their camp-fires, and old songs are sung ... and ghost-stories retold. And in the darkness sometimes they hear the ghost-bird screaming its `Haku-ai, haku-ai, Ooh!' and then a hair-raising swoosh of great wings ... This bird, called the `hakuai' from its call, is spoken of as a spirit. ... The mystery of the hakuai may be dispelled by assuming it to be ... the frigate-bird (Fregata aquila). <i>(1906,TrNZi,38/340</i>)

>  The Maori word <i>hakuwai</i> (or <i>hakawai</i> or <i>hakuai</i>, or any of at least five other variant spellings, including the European <i>harkowhy</i>) was defined by Williams in his <i>Maori Dictionary</i> as 'an extinct bird heard at night'. <i>(Aug 2000,NZWords,No. 4: 5</i>)

>  <b>ANDERSON</b> it is a moot point whether the name <i>hakuwai</i> was derived from <i>hokioi</i>.. or whether <i>hokioi</i> has been adopted., as an imperfect rendition of <i>hakuwai</i>, to provide a name for the eagle legend. <i>(1989,Prodigious Birds,91</i>)

>  <b>HENDERSON</b> He heard the harkowhy up in Canaan on the Takaka Hill, the ghost-bird never seen but many times heard by muttonbirders and the odd fisherman in the mist and fog in Stewart island, crying like a chain rattling. <i>(1983,Down from Marble Mountain,142</i>)

## half savage

>  Coming to a country where there were no legal means of enforcing such rights, when objected to, did the first settlers expect to walk into every acre without opposition? or, if not, were the Company to provide an army to give possession by force? or, if not that, did they believe that the cupidity of the half-savage was not inextinguishable by feeding it, and that additional gifts and presents would not be building a barrier to keep them from their lands? <i>(Jun 3, 1843,Nelson Examiner and New Zealand Chronicle,258</i>)

>  it may have suited those who were favourable to the success of the "King movement" to conceal its real purport; while others, who have cherished so much affection for the natives or professed so much interest in their welfare, may have been blinded to the inevitable results of encouraging such dangerous aspirations among the half-savage chiefs and tribes ... <i>(Jan 4, 1862,Taranaki Herald,5</i>)

>  <b>REiSCHEK</b> Perhaps, also, he will help to remind them how good, how strenuous life was `in the good old days,' when their Dominion was still half-savage, still unsettled after the toughest of colonial wars, and before the fire and axe of succeeding generations of peaceful settlers had robbed her of so much of her incomparable possession, the native bush. <i>(1930,Yesterdays in Maoriland,7,(1933) H.E.L.

 <i>n.</i> any corridor, passage or extended landing in a house. [Jim writes NZPOD (but not DNZE) records this extended NZ use.

I can support this by an anecdote of a minor domestic catastrophe. My wife (who grew up in England) asked my son to strip the wallpaper in the hall, by which she meant the front hall. He did this but went on to deal with a passage at the top of the stairs!]

 <i>n.</i> (sheepdog trials)

>  <b>McLiNTOCK</b> Heading. in the long head the competitor stands with his dog in a ring (1 chain in diameter) facing a hillside near the top of which three sheep are set loose. When time is called the dog is dispatched, either on a left-hand or a right-hand cast, up the hill for some 800 yards to a point behind the sheep. On command the dog `lifts' the sheep and, keeping them together, `pulls' them in a direct line back to his master in the ring. To allow the dog to show complete control over the sheep, the run ends with a `hold in the ring'. This involves stopping the sheep in the ring and holding them there. The first stages of the short head are much the same, but over half the distance, 400 yards. At the point where the sheep reach the shepherd, man and dog must drive them ahead down a `drive' which is 60 yards long and 1 chain wide and defined by short poles, to a set of hurdles which are 9 ft apart and parallel with the line of the drive.

After opening one side, the competitor must stand by the pen gate until the sheep are yarded. The dog must do virtually all the work and his master's right of movement and intervention are strictly limited. <i>(1966,Encyclopaedia of New Zealand, An,1/493</i>)

>  The herd-testing movement is worthy of special mention. Practically 20 per cent. of the dairy cows in the Dominion are tested for butter-fat production monthly during the milking season. <i>ibid.</i> 346 Although herd testing and milk recording societies existed in Germany, Denmark, England and other countries many years earlier, systematic herd testing appears to have been first developed in New Zealand about the year 1920, when a model Herd Testing Association was established by the New Zealand Department of Agriculture in the Wairarapa. <i>(1936,Agricultural Organization in NZ,26</i>)



 
 <i>n.</i> the testing of dairy herds for disease, or to estimate milk production, etc. [cf. cow-testing]

>  We have been rather keen on herd-testing in this district and most folks [get] the herd-tester to do their cows. <i>(Jan 22, 1927,NZ Dairy Produce Exporter,35</i>)

>  <b>POWDRELL</b> Herd-testing. - it is strongly maintained that herd-testing - the periodical recording of the weight of each cow's produce together with a butter-fat test from which data the production of the cow for the period is calculated - is the surest way of distinguishing the drones ... <i>(1920,Dairy Farming in NZ,46</i>)

>  As the result of herd testing, greater attention to culling and breeding and improved farm management, the average butterfat yield per cow increased from 154.25 lbs. per annum in 1920-21 to 218.80 lbs. per annum in 1929-30. <i>ibid.</i> 345 The major function of Herd Testing is primarily to determine the milk and butterfat producing ability of individual cows, and from this information to secure accurate data for the elimination of low-producing cows and also to provide a more scientific basis for the breeding of dairy stock. <i>(1936,Agricultural Organization in NZ,28</i>)

>  <b>TURNER</b> A cow with `a good test', that is, milk rich in butterfat, may be more valuable than another cow that gives more milk. About 1910 the practice rose of smpling milk from all the cows in a herd individually and testing the milk for its fat content. This process is called herd-testing. ... it is still not decided whether the word is hyphenated or not. i find it without a hyphen in a publication of the Department of Agriculture in 1950, with a hyphen in a textbook of dairying in 1955. Pronunciation is with one stress, on herd. <i>ibid.</i> 149 in New Zealand, everyone uses the term herd-testing, not milk-testing, because everyone thinks of the dairy industry from a producer's, not a consumer's, point of view. <i>(1966,English Language in Aust. & NZ, The,45</i>)

<b>1</b> <i>n.</i> (Rural) the testing of dairy herds to assess quality and quantity of milk in each cow.

>  Herd-testing in New Zealand since the close of the Great War has been increasingly very rapidly year by year, and it would seem that a stage has now been reached when a steadying-up in the progress of the movement is likely to be evidenced. <i>(Oct 20, 1926,NZ Journal of Agriculture,217</i>)

>  Dairy insight will want at least $10, AB, herd-testing, shed power, shed expenses and animal health will take out the best part of $100 [per cow] ... [herdtesting] <i>(May 2, 2002,Taranaki Daily News,18</i>)

>  <b>BEATTiE</b> The custom in the old days was to call the buildings on a run `the station,' and the land that went with it was `the run.' On a big property you could find several `stations,' and the principal one was called `the home station,' while the others were `out-stations.' This was the old Australian usage which was carried over to New Zealand at first, but gradually the signification was altered by loosely calling the whole run a station, and then the real station became a homestead and the out-stations became shepherds' huts. in this present book it will be noticed that generally the writer has preserved the olden custom of calling the main buildings the station and the land the run. The runs over in Australia being, as a rule, much larger than those in New Zealand, the `station' and `out-station' phraseology was preserved much longer than over here, where even in advertisements in the late 'fifties we see the English word `homestead' ousting the colonial word `station.' <i>(1947,Early Runholding in Otago,11</i>)

>  <b>BEATTiE</b> it is usually understood that in the early days the word `station' denoted the owner's house and its immediate buildings, while `run' meant the whole property. Strange to say, i only noted the word `station' twice, and each time with a diverse meaning. On July 21, 1865, the diary says: `Sold 17 head of cattle - remaining on station 15 head.' Then on September 11, 1865, we read: `Wilkinson returned to the Home Station.' The first of these entries means the whole run - the second the homestead or main buildings. <i>(1947,Early Runholding in Otago,115</i>) [NOTES: -->1947 Beattie Early Runholding 115 quoting 1856 July 21 Puketoi Station Diary]

That is, `My town house is a townhouse', correctly distinguishes, on the page, and will be distinguished in speech; tow stresses for the one, and one stress (TOWNhouse) for the other.

>  Hollywood ensured the words Home Alone were something to chuckle about. A 10-year-old's mischievous romps while left to his own devices were laughed at by millions. However, in New Zealand the phrase has a more depressing definition. "Home alone" is synonymous with the neglect of children for their welfare or the foolhardy belief "nothing can go wrong" even if mum and dad are just popping to the shops for 15 minutes.... The home-alone law has been accused of hurting children because fining parents meant there would be less money for the family. <i>(Oct 26, 1997,Sunday Star Times,A8</i>)

>  <b>BEATTiE</b> The custom in the old days was to call the buildings on a run `the station,' and the land that went with it was `the run.' On a big property you could find several `stations,' and the principal one was called `the home station,' while the others were `out-stations.' This was the old Australian usage which was carried over to New Zealand at first, but gradually the signification was altered by loosely calling the whole run a station, and then the real station became a homestead and the out-stations became shepherds' huts. in this present book it will be noticed that generally the writer has preserved the olden custom of calling the main buildings the station and the land the run. The runs over in Australia being, as a rule, much larger than those in New Zealand, the `station' and `out-station' phraseology was preserved much longer than over here, where even in advertisements in the late 'fifties we see the English word `homestead' ousting the colonial word `station.' <i>(1947,Early Runholding in Otago,11</i>)

Orig. a European rendering of the Maori noun utu, return (for anything ); satisfaction, ransom, reward, price, reply' (Williams); not to be used confused with uto `revenge', a confusion evident in many of the explanations of the meaning of utu). The word widely used was in all the above senses by Europeans who had dealings with Maoris, from the general `return for work, injury, etc.' to the concrete `money' it is often found constructed with the definite article `the utu, hutu' etc. translating the original Maori indefinite article, or adjective `some' he utu `an utu, some utu'. (Occas. constr with indef. article, see 1834). in later European usage the definite article was dropped to conform to English idiom eg' `give me the hoot' becomes `give me (some) hoot' The following is perhaps a `transitional' use 1828 C Davis journal Colenso Papers 3/18) `Another chief had been killed as a utu or payment'. (is this [ei utu] reflecting Maori [(h)e utu], as well as English a for an?). The phonology, resulting in the English hoot, parallels that of toot from tutu, with the final unvoiced [u] not being heard by English ears. The initial [h] derives perhaps from a syncopation of [he utu]; but more prob. from the var. or error noted on p. 4 of 1842: Maunsell Grammar of the New Zealand Language (4th ed) 1894: `in pronouncing u, the speaker will have to guard against the error of those who prefix the aspirate when no aspirate is admissable.

In the more Maori districts the use would still have primary Maori meanings and associations, while in Otago, where there were few Maoris, the transference to purely European idiom be could completed much earlier. This transference was probably helped by rhyme with loot (cf the ? mistaken interpretation of 1845 Barnicoat Journal 163. `Our first endeavour was to get a native as a guide over the hills `How much the loot' of course was the answer to our enquiries.') though op. cit 190 `bargained for utu'); loot could have been an occasional joking word for money, although it is not attested in NZ until fairly recently but cf Partridge.

The Maori equivalent for money is utu, pronounced by the Ngapuhi and other northern tribes with the last syllable clipped, and the word is very largely used by the kauri-gum diggers and station hands in the North island. The original meaning of first settled in New Zealand, they found that the savage inhabitants had no conception of any recompense except the grim recompense of blood. Under Christianizing influences the natives were induced to forego the blood-revenge for injuries, on receiving a solatium in goods or land, and so utu came to have the double meaning of revenge and recompense, and eventually became recognized as the Maori word for money.' <i>(Jan 12, 1896,Truth (Sydney)</i>)

>  <b>PALENSKi</b> it is often assumed that the phrase [sc. the "House of Pain"] came to be applied by visiting teams because of the perceived difficulty of winning at Carisbrook. it actually began, however, in the late 1980s within the Otago team when players referred to Carisbrook as the House of Pain, because of exhausting training sessions. it was once attributed to an Otago player of the time, Brent Pope, and he happily claimed the credit for it, but it's difficult to pin down to one person. it's only in recent years that it's been seen as the House of Pain for visiting teams - a belief encouraged by Radio Sport (which began in 1998) commentators who had little or no acquaintance with either the ground or the phrase. <i>(Sep 28, 2004,Letter</i>)

>  <b>RENNiE</b> The Beardie was developed as a barking dog because in some parts of Scotland, particularly in the Western Highlands, much of the ground is covered with bracken, which combined with the deep gullies known as corries, makes it impossible for a heading dog to see his sheep. Here the shepherd has to get out above the sheep and more or less chase them out of the thick cover. These dogs were known as hunters, and it is presumably an adaptation of this name which led to the designation, huntaway. At the turn of the century there were four well known strains of huntaways about North Canterbury and Marlborough - the Clown, Rag, Borderglen's Rose and Pollock's Old Clyde breeds. Of these the Clown strain certainly had Beardie blood, believed to have been started with a half Beardie brought out from Scotland. <i>(1985,Working Dogs,12</i>)

Mr Smith said that during the trial the jury would hear about what was known colloquially as a `hydraulic deal'. This was a situation where there was a deal in which a dealer intended to sell a truck for, say, $50,000 and required a deposit of $10,000 by any hire purchaser. in the case of a $50,000 truck (a hypothetical example) the dealer knew the hire purchase company was going to have reservations about financing the full $50,000. `So the dealer draws up a hire purchase agreement anyway. The real price is still $50,000. But on the agreement the dealer said he had received the sum of $10,000 by way of deposit.' Mr Smith said that if a hire purchase company accepted the assignment of the agreement the dealer got his money in full and the customer got his truck (then claimed to be worth $60,000) without having to pay a deposit. <i>(Apr 12, 1985,Evening Post</i>) [NOTES: 1985?
