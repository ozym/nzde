## H.P.R.
 
 <i>abbr.</i> homestead pre-emptive right [(hist.)]

>  <b>CRAWFORD</b> Although many runholders came to regard the land they leased as their own, their occupancy was intended to be only a temporary using of waste land until it was required for closer settlement. Anyone - the runholder included - could buy the freehold of all or any part of a run at any time to establish a farm. However, some protection for runholders was essential, for they could not be expected to improve their runs if the land and improvements were in danger of being freeholded without warning by an outside buyer. Runholders were able to register with the Provincial Council improvements such as buildings, plantations, fencing, and yards, for which they were granted [246] an improvement pre-emptive right (i.P.R.) covering fifty acres of land surrounding the improvement. A homestead pre-emptive right (H.P.R.), which afforded protection for 250 acres, could also be registered. ... One H.P.R. could be taken out for each property and it was only businesslike that each runholder should use this right to secure 250 acres around his homestead against purchase by an outsider. An H.P.R. was initially intended to cover the owner's or manager's home, but, in the case of runs of over 5,000 acres, could be extended to cover an outstation.

## hakuwai
 
 <i>n.</i> A Maori legendary bird, said to be heard at night but never seen. (Suggested originals include frigate bird, Haast's eagle; the most probable being Miskelly below, i.e. NZ snipe in display flights.) See also hokioi. [19?? Miskelly in Notornis 34 get cit]

>  Many legends are associated with the mythical bird "hokioi"... in the South and in some parts of the North island it is identical, apparently, with the "hakuwai" which has seven joints in its wing, lives in the sky, and presages trouble... "its cry was Hokioi! Hokioi! Hu!" The last word represented the whizzing sound made by the bird in flight. (Sep 11, 1912 -- ,Otago Witness,76)

>  <b>DEMPSEY</b> The Mysterious Ha-ka-wai Bird [heading] No-one has ever seen it, no-one knows what it is like. Mutton-birders who have heard the strange sound of its passing over the islands at night speak of the ha-ka-wai bird. A swish of wings close overhead, a sound like the rattle of chains when a boat lets the anchor down, again the sound of wingbeats and the cry floating earthward from the heavens, Ha-ka-wai! Ha-ka-wai! in a drawn-out singsong with accent on the first and last syllables. (1964 -- ,Little World of Stewart island,61)

>  A strange bird in Maori eyes is the hakuai of the off-shore islands in the far south. ... Whole families go mutton-birding ... At night the fowlers gather round their camp-fires, and old songs are sung ... and ghost-stories retold. And in the darkness sometimes they hear the ghost-bird screaming its `Haku-ai, haku-ai, Ooh!' and then a hair-raising swoosh of great wings ... This bird, called the `hakuai' from its call, is spoken of as a spirit. ... The mystery of the hakuai may be dispelled by assuming it to be ... the frigate-bird (Fregata aquila). (1906 -- ,TrNZi,38/340)

>  The Maori word <i>hakuwai</i> (or <i>hakawai</i> or <i>hakuai</i>, or any of at least five other variant spellings, including the European <i>harkowhy</i>) was defined by Williams in his <i>Maori Dictionary</i> as 'an extinct bird heard at night'. (Aug 2000 -- ,NZWords,No. 4: 5)

 <i>n.</i> (sheepdog trials)

>  <b>McLiNTOCK</b> Heading. in the long head the competitor stands with his dog in a ring (1 chain in diameter) facing a hillside near the top of which three sheep are set loose. When time is called the dog is dispatched, either on a left-hand or a right-hand cast, up the hill for some 800 yards to a point behind the sheep. On command the dog `lifts' the sheep and, keeping them together, `pulls' them in a direct line back to his master in the ring. To allow the dog to show complete control over the sheep, the run ends with a `hold in the ring'. This involves stopping the sheep in the ring and holding them there. The first stages of the short head are much the same, but over half the distance, 400 yards. At the point where the sheep reach the shepherd, man and dog must drive them ahead down a `drive' which is 60 yards long and 1 chain wide and defined by short poles, to a set of hurdles which are 9 ft apart and parallel with the line of the drive. The sheep are driven between the hurdles and then down a second drive, similar to the first, to the pen or yard, which is 6 ft square. After opening one side, the competitor must stand by the pen gate until the sheep are yarded. The dog must do virtually all the work and his master's right of movement and intervention are strictly limited. (1966 -- ,Encyclopaedia of New Zealand, An,1/493)

>  <b>BEATTiE</b> The custom in the old days was to call the buildings on a run `the station,' and the land that went with it was `the run.' On a big property you could find several `stations,' and the principal one was called `the home station,' while the others were `out-stations.' This was the old Australian usage which was carried over to New Zealand at first, but gradually the signification was altered by loosely calling the whole run a station, and then the real station became a homestead and the out-stations became shepherds' huts. in this present book it will be noticed that generally the writer has preserved the olden custom of calling the main buildings the station and the land the run. The runs over in Australia being, as a rule, much larger than those in New Zealand, the `station' and `out-station' phraseology was preserved much longer than over here, where even in advertisements in the late 'fifties we see the English word `homestead' ousting the colonial word `station.' (1947 -- ,Early Runholding in Otago,11)

>  <b>BEATTiE</b> it is usually understood that in the early days the word `station' denoted the owner's house and its immediate buildings, while `run' meant the whole property. Strange to say, i only noted the word `station' twice, and each time with a diverse meaning. On July 21, 1865, the diary says: `Sold 17 head of cattle - remaining on station 15 head.' Then on September 11, 1865, we read: `Wilkinson returned to the Home Station.' The first of these entries means the whole run - the second the homestead or main buildings.

>  Review NZPOD Town house is in, and uneasily acceptable as a `residence in town esp. of person with house in the country' although `in the country' could be better phrased; but `house in (esp. terraced) group in town' is not apt, and increasingly the style for this type of dwelling is townhouse. That is, `My town house is a townhouse', correctly distinguishes, on the page, and will be distinguished in speech; tow stresses for the one, and one stress (TOWNhouse) for the other.

## home-alone
 
 <i>adj.</i> [probably US; the English equivalent seems to be "latchkey kids".]

>  Hollywood ensured the words Home Alone were something to chuckle about. A 10-year-old's mischievous romps while left to his own devices were laughed at by millions. However, in New Zealand the phrase has a more depressing definition. "Home alone" is synonymous with the neglect of children for their welfare or the foolhardy belief "nothing can go wrong" even if mum and dad are just popping to the shops for 15 minutes.... The home-alone law has been accused of hurting children because fining parents meant there would be less money for the family. (Oct 26, 1997 -- ,Sunday Star Times,A8)

>  <b>BEATTiE</b> The custom in the old days was to call the buildings on a run `the station,' and the land that went with it was `the run.' On a big property you could find several `stations,' and the principal one was called `the home station,' while the others were `out-stations.' This was the old Australian usage which was carried over to New Zealand at first, but gradually the signification was altered by loosely calling the whole run a station, and then the real station became a homestead and the out-stations became shepherds' huts. in this present book it will be noticed that generally the writer has preserved the olden custom of calling the main buildings the station and the land the run. The runs over in Australia being, as a rule, much larger than those in New Zealand, the `station' and `out-station' phraseology was preserved much longer than over here, where even in advertisements in the late 'fifties we see the English word `homestead' ousting the colonial word `station.'

Orig. a European rendering of the Maori noun utu, return (for anything ); satisfaction, ransom, reward, price, reply' (Williams); not to be used confused with uto `revenge', a confusion evident in many of the explanations of the meaning of utu). The word widely used was in all the above senses by Europeans who had dealings with Maoris, from the general `return for work, injury, etc.' to the concrete `money' it is often found constructed with the definite article `the utu, hutu' etc. translating the original Maori indefinite article, or adjective `some' he utu `an utu, some utu'. (Occas. constr with indef. article, see 1834). in later European usage the definite article was dropped to conform to English idiom eg' `give me the hoot' becomes `give me (some) hoot' The following is perhaps a `transitional' use 1828 C Davis journal Colenso Papers 3/18) `Another chief had been killed as a utu or payment'. (is this [ei utu] reflecting Maori [(h)e utu], as well as English a for an?). The phonology, resulting in the English hoot, parallels that of toot from tutu, with the final unvoiced [u] not being heard by English ears. The initial [h] derives perhaps from a syncopation of [he utu]; but more prob. from the var. or error noted on p. 4 of 1842: Maunsell Grammar of the New Zealand Language (4th ed) 1894: `in pronouncing u, the speaker will have to guard against the error of those who prefix the aspirate when no aspirate is admissable.

In the more Maori districts the use would still have primary Maori meanings and associations, while in Otago, where there were few Maoris, the transference to purely European idiom be could completed much earlier. This transference was probably helped by rhyme with loot (cf the ? mistaken interpretation of 1845 Barnicoat Journal 163. `Our first endeavour was to get a native as a guide over the hills `How much the loot' of course was the answer to our enquiries.') though op. cit 190 `bargained for utu'); loot could have been an occasional joking word for money, although it is not attested in NZ until fairly recently but cf Partridge.

The Maori equivalent for money is utu, pronounced by the Ngapuhi and other northern tribes with the last syllable clipped, and the word is very largely used by the kauri-gum diggers and station hands in the North island. The original meaning of first settled in New Zealand, they found that the savage inhabitants had no conception of any recompense except the grim recompense of blood. Under Christianizing influences the natives were induced to forego the blood-revenge for injuries, on receiving a solatium in goods or land, and so utu came to have the double meaning of revenge and recompense, and eventually became recognized as the Maori word for money.'

At the turn of the century there were four well known strains of huntaways about North Canterbury and Marlborough - the Clown, Rag, Borderglen's Rose and Pollock's Old Clyde breeds. Of these the Clown strain certainly had Beardie blood, believed to have been started with a half Beardie brought out from Scotland. (1985 -- ,Working Dogs,12)

Mr Smith said that during the trial the jury would hear about what was known colloquially as a `hydraulic deal'. This was a situation where there was a deal in which a dealer intended to sell a truck for, say, $50,000 and required a deposit of $10,000 by any hire purchaser. in the case of a $50,000 truck (a hypothetical example) the dealer knew the hire purchase company was going to have reservations about financing the full $50,000. `So the dealer draws up a hire purchase agreement anyway. The real price is still $50,000. But on the agreement the dealer said he had received the sum of $10,000 by way of deposit.' Mr Smith said that if a hire purchase company accepted the assignment of the agreement the dealer got his money in full and the customer got his truck (then claimed to be worth $60,000) without having to pay a deposit.
