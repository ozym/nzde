Maori,1977,Moa-Hunters of NZ,DUFF,12,,"This raises the question of what we mean by the term Maori. Why should Kupe be termed a Maori, if (according to Maori tradition) he was a Society Islands voyager of some 1,000 years ago who touched at New Zealand in the course of exploring voyages and returned to his homeland? By what greater right can we apply the term to Toi who arrived from the same part of the Pacific 200 years later to settle in New Zealand, or to the numerous voyagers subsequent to Toi and culminating in the Hawaiki Fleet of 1350? Every immigrant from tropical Polynesia did not become a Maori the moment he stepped ashore in New Zealand. The culture which we have come to know as Maori was undoubtedly the end product of a long period of local development, probably not reaching its final perfection of form until after the visit of Tasman. The use of the term Maori (lit. normal, ordinary or proper) to distinguish the Polynesian inhabitants of New Zealand from the intrusive European is even more clearly a late development and certainly post-European.* [fn] Williams (1921) notes no literary use before 1850 of the Maori in its present sense.

matai beer,1961,Puborama,MACKAY,95,,"In the rip-roaring times of the King Country, Matai beer was a favourite with those who were strong enough and tough enough to drink it.

The favourite recipe for this form of wood alcohol represented the addition of three or four cupsful of the sap to each gallon of `ordinary' liquid refreshment. That the resultant mixture had a pretty hefty kick to it may be judged from this description handed in to the Taihape newspaper (1912): `Matai beer is the term used to describe a certain brand or grade of alcoholic brew.

It was a pure clear liquid, and it gushed out like the main artery gushing blood. But that used to be prized, and it would be caught in a billy. That was really something. It was beautiful and cool and sweet to drink as it was, but some of the blokes used to bung in maybe a handful of raisins and sugar and cork her up and let her ferment, and whether that fluid had any other properties in it or not I don't know, but you could get quite a potent drink from it.","(Bob Edwards, bushman)"

[XII] The term Moa-hunter follows the practice in culture-phase designation of coining a label of contrast. Although Moa-hunter Maoris gathered shell-fish and hunted all available birds, fish, seals and small whales, the cultural and economic phase is conveniently designated from the Moa as the largest and most spectacular game animal available during man's first adaptation to the environment and the one no longer available in the Classic Maori era. The term Moa-hunter is preferred here to the longer `Archaic Phase of New Zealand East Polynesian', too easily corrupted to `Archaic Maori', with `Archaic' meaning only `early'.",

In the country mongrel has two independent meanings. (i) A dog of mixed blood. Objective - no emotional content. Indeed `pedigreed' is acquiring something of the mongrel taint, in that if a good dog has a pedigree it is mentioned with a faint note of surprise. (ii) A `no-good' whether man or animal. `He turned out mongrel' (Rod Macaulay speaking of a pedigreed mastiff that took to sheep worrying.) `When Bill brought him home I knew he'd turn out a mongrel. Sort of a cow-y look about his head.' (Walter Hull discussing a pedigreed `Totara Park' Friesian bull which proved sterile.)",1952 p.c.

At least as probable is the theory that the name refers to the rather woolly appearance of the downy young. In New Zealand other petrels are also given the name `muttonbird'. In fact, the sooty shearwater, which is most abundant on the islands about Foveaux Strait, might well be called the <i>southern</i> muttonbird, and the grey-faced petrel, predominant on the islands off the coast of Auckland Province,the <i>northern</i> muttonbird.
