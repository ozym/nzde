## Maori

 <i>n.</i> (attrib. use) Maori(dom) as a field of study

 <i>n.</i> [There is a discussion on the word in the `Journal of Polynesian Society,' vol. i. no. 3, vol. ii. no. I, and vol. iii. no. I. Bishop Williams (4th ed.) says that the word means, `of the normal or usual kind.' The Pakehas were not men to whom the natives were accustomed. So Maori was used as opposed to the Europeans, the white-skins. <i>Kuri Maori</i> was a name used for a dog after the arrival of other quadrupeds called also <i>kuri. Wai maori</i> was fresh-water, oridinary as opposed to sea-water. Another explanation is that the word meant `indigenous,' and that there are kindred words with that meaning in other Polynesian languages. First, `indigenous,' or "of the native race,' and then with a secondary meaning, `ours.' (See `Tregear's Maori Comparative Dictionary,' s.v.) The form of the plural varies, The form <i>Maoris</i> is considered the more correct, but the form <i>Maories</i> is frequently used by good writers.]

 <i>n.</i> an aboriginal or native New Zealander; pertaining to the Maori. Spg <i>Mouri, Mauri, Mawnee</i>, [? typographical or transcription error], in the earliest texts; <i>mouray Mao[diereis]ri Maori</i> from at least 1842 (with occasional lower case m.) Plural. Mauries, Mauris, Mouries, Maories; Mauri, Mouri, Maori. The plural <i>Maories</i> can be found in written texts to the 1870's or 1880's; and is not uncommon in informal written English today, though usually regarded as a spelling error. The plural <i>Maori</i> has been usual among those with knowledge of Maori; and among those who are sensitive to Maori usage or feeling. <i>Synonyms.</i> Leaving aside the very early (Cook, Banks) <i>Indian </i>q.v., early writers used <i>native</i> (as n and aj.) or <i>New Zealander </i>q.v. as the preferred terms, with<i> aborigine</i> q.v. being common in early writing asociated with `imperial' agencies as the Colonial Office and the Church Missionary Society, and was reinforced by the early appointment of a <i>Protector of Aborigines</i>. Early uses of <i>Maori</i> were usually tagged with an explanatory `native"; and indeed <i>Maori </i>did not replace <i>Native</i> in official use until 1947 when the name of the Department of Native Affairs was replaced by `Maori Affairs'.

 <i>adv.</i> [ca1935 Havelock <i>to go Maori</i>, of a European, to live in an inferior fashion. <i>to act the Maori</i>, to show uncivilised or aggressive behaviour.]

 <i>n.</i> plural is Maoris or Maori 1. a) a member of the tangata whenua, the Polynesian race that first peopled New Zealand. b) a Polynesian of the Cook Islands. Compare PAKEHA. 2. their languages. Maori adjective (usually capital, can be offensive in some non-Maori use) 1. a) of or pertaining to Maori peoples or culture (often replacing earlier native): `Maori Battalion'; `Maori Affairs Department'; `Maori oven'. b) use can be derogatory or stereotypical: `Maori cannon'. 2. a) indigenous, native to New Zealand: `Maori bug'; `Maori hen'. b) undomesticated (synonym is wild): `Maori cabbage'; `Maori celery'; `Maori dog'. [Maori Maori originally an adjective, normal, usual, ordinary] [For fuller discussion of theories of origin, and applications, of MAORI (and PAKEHA) see Journal Polynesian Soc. 54/4/223-234; [etc.] Maori, <i>maaori </i> see also taha maori, tangata maori, copper maori , pro-Maori include in article Maori as a subject of study: e.g. Maori was admitted at last as a university subject: a Chair of Maori ??? -->pl forms Maori the native race, or several Maoris, is becoming the preferred pl among maoriphiles: Maories quite common until the 1870s;]

 <i>n.</i> a children's game

 <i>adj.</i> native, a new formation from MAORI n. use B used attributively, thence adjectivally rather than a borrowing or continuation of use A.

 <i>n.</i> women's formation marching as a competitive sport [It seems the trail leads back to Aucklandabout 1924 at earliest, first real exhibition probably 1926; competitions between various factories in the clothing trade. The restrictions on uniforms mentioned below were brought in to prevent big firms outspending the smallones by providing splendiferous uniforms. Organisations outside the rag trade do not seem to have been allowed in officially into Interhouse Marching until about 1954. Despite the evidence below that it started in Auckland under Jean Stevenson, Bateman's Encyclopedia says marching started in Wellington and spread to Auckland later. It must be wrong. The plot thickens. Passing through London Bookshop today I spotted Gordon Ell's new book on NZ Trivia and Kiwiana and he says Marching Girls started in Dunedin in the 1920s. have I found any early Auckland ones, nothing before 1941 in Wellington. guess is that one or other or both of Jean Stevenson and Kathleen Montgomery started them in Auckland and through the YWCA spread them rapidly throughout the main centres.]

## mongrel

 <i>n.</i> 1952 Feb 16 R.Gilberd notes on Mongrel Reading `Talking of Words' (Cecil Hull) p21`We might objectively and scientifically describe him, if he were ours, as a dog of mixed breeds - ... we would not be pleased if an acquaintance calls that dog a mongrel.' In town where dogs are kept largely for appearance and display `mongrel' I think has only one meaning - that a dog is of mixed breeding (with a note of disapproval or contempt). In the country mongrel has two independent meanings. (i) A dog of mixed blood. Objective - no emotional content. Indeed `pedigreed' is acquiring something of the mongrel taint, in that if a good dog has a pedigree it is mentioned with a faint note of surprise. (ii) A `no-good' whether man or animal. `He turned out mongrel' (Rod Macaulay speaking of a pedigreed mastiff that took to sheep worrying.) `When Bill brought him home I knew he'd turn out a mongrel. Sort of a cow-y look about his head.' (Walter Hull discussing a pedigreed `Totara Park' Friesian bull which proved sterile.) Talking of dogs: An `eye-dog' is a specialised type of header which works very quietly, never taking its eyes off the sheep it is trying to pen. Sheep men generally seem to think the dog hypnotises the sheep into being penned quietly. I believe that the fixity of its gaze and its complete concentration enable it to detect and counter any rebelliousness on the part of the sheep before the sheep have quite made up their minds.
