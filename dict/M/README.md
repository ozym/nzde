 <i>n.</i> a type (or stereotype) of the independent, outdoors New Zealander. [also attrib.]

>  The narrative voice in Stephen Sinclair's first novel is a familiar one, one that has appeared in "man alone" novels from John Mulgan's landmark book that gave the genre its name in 1939 to Owen Marshall's <i>Harlequin Rex</i> last year. (Sep 2, 2000 -- ,Listener (New Zealand Listener),46)

>  <b>FRANCIS</b> <i>Man Alone</i> [chapter heading] (1983 -- ,Wildlife Ranger,72)

>  "Mulgan's only novel was a remarkably mature evocation of God's own country going to the dogs in the post-World War I decades. Its iconic reputation as a book that celebrates rugged individualism and self-sufficiency is in potent conflict with the socialistic implications of its title that derives from Ernest Hemingway's statement in <i>To Have and Have Not</i> that 'a man alone ain't got no bloody f---ing chance'." - Peter Simpson (Mar 20, 2004 -- ,Listener (New Zealand Listener),61)

>  For Mackenzie, this isolation may have been from necessity, but it was his ability to deal with this aloneness that enabled him to access this landscape like no other settler of his time. In fact, Mackenzie's story may have been the foundation of the "man alone" genre that still permeates New Zealand film and literature to this day. (Mar 13, 2004 -- ,Listener (New Zealand Listener),46)

>  It would probably take a scholarly thesis, however, to examine the way that Crump first popularised, then personified and finally parodied the Man Alone myth that has run though this country's literature like a strand of No. 8 wire... "The notion of the Man Alone figure goes way back to the 19th century and to a certain extent it occurs in Australian writing as well; so he comes out of a long tradition, really... The coup de grace was the Toyota ad campaign of the 80s and 90s in which Man Alone tackled the wilderness in a Japanese car. (Feb 20, 1999 -- ,Listener (New Zealand Listener),33)

>  Against the triumphalism of the New Zealand narrative as the "Man Alone" story, a Puritan hangover, Robin Hyde is emerging as the ghost-writer in the sky, retrospectively altering New Zealand literary history, not so much as "Woman Alone", although she was that, but as a communal writer; one writing to include the dispossessed, the outcast, one writing against the dominant paradigm.

## manaaki/manaakitanga

It is related to the term `mana', and refers to a person's finer qualities rather than what a person has in terms of material goods. If a Maori shows warmth, respect and kindness to people, they are showing manaakitanga. The most humble homes can show this quality as much as wealthy homes - it is giving from the heart. (1985 -- ,Towards Taha Maori,20)

>  <b>BEATTIE</b> When in a hurry, or feeling orthographically tired, he [the southerner] calls the big manuka `kaikatoa.' A southern Maori once said to me:- `We did not pronounce the word manuka like some northerners who throw the accent forward and say `man-u-ka,' nor like the bushmen, who say `m'nooka,' but about halfway between these two pronouncing each part clearly as mah-nook-a.' Unless my hearing deceives me this throws the emphasis on the central syllable while leaving the first syllable clearly pronounced. It is a remarkable fact that while the manuka is so common its name is so seldom used in the composition of place-names. (1944 -- ,Maori Place-Names of Otago,39)

>  <i>ma[a]nuka</i>, a shrub (Leptospermum scoparium), commonly called tea-tree, because Cook's people used the fresh young leaves infused for tea; but very often mis-spelt ti-tree - ti being something totally different, the cabbage tree (Cordyline). The tree-manuka is kanuka, with smaller leaves and smaller flowers than the scrub-manuka, and it is the kanuka that is usually sold for firewood. I spoke to a dealer about it, and he said they dodged the confusion by selling it as T.T. There is a crimson-flowering variety of manuka known in England as a rarity, but by means of slips (not seed) it has become not uncommon. The starry-flowered manuka would have been adopted as the national flower but for the fact that it is too prolific, and apt to become a nuisance. It has a second name, kahika[a]toa but that is discouraged on account of its spelling being so nearly the same as kahikatea, the white pine, though in sound they are quite different, the macron in hahika[a]toa causing an apparent accent which, when observed, clearly differentiates the two words: it is not an accent, however, but a lengthening of the vowel.

 <i>n.</i> [There is a discussion on the word in the `Journal of Polynesian Society,' vol. i. no. 3, vol. ii. no. I, and vol. iii. no. I. Bishop Williams (4th ed.) says that the word means, `of the normal or usual kind.' The Pakehas were not men to whom the natives were accustomed. So Maori was used as opposed to the Europeans, the white-skins. <i>Kuri Maori</i> was a name used for a dog after the arrival of other quadrupeds called also <i>kuri. Wai maori</i> was fresh-water, oridinary as opposed to sea-water. Another explanation is that the word meant `indigenous,' and that there are kindred words with that meaning in other Polynesian languages. First, `indigenous,' or "of the native race,' and then with a secondary meaning, `ours.' (See `Tregear's Maori Comparative Dictionary,' s.v.) The form of the plural varies, The form <i>Maoris</i> is considered the more correct, but the form <i>Maories</i> is frequently used by good writers.]

>  <b>DUFF</b> This raises the question of what we mean by the term Maori. Why should Kupe be termed a Maori, if (according to Maori tradition) he was a Society Islands voyager of some 1,000 years ago who touched at New Zealand in the course of exploring voyages and returned to his homeland? By what greater right can we apply the term to Toi who arrived from the same part of the Pacific 200 years later to settle in New Zealand, or to the numerous voyagers subsequent to Toi and culminating in the Hawaiki Fleet of 1350? Every immigrant from tropical Polynesia did not become a Maori the moment he stepped ashore in New Zealand. The culture which we have come to know as Maori was undoubtedly the end product of a long period of local development, probably not reaching its final perfection of form until after the visit of Tasman. The use of the term Maori (lit. normal, ordinary or proper) to distinguish the Polynesian inhabitants of New Zealand from the intrusive European is even more clearly a late development and certainly post-European.* [fn] Williams (1921) notes no literary use before 1850 of the Maori in its present sense. Scholefield (1945) puts its use back to 1840, in the translation of the Treaty of Waitangi. McNab, quoted by Shrimpton and Mulgan, without the reference being cited, states that its earliest use was in 1818. (1977 -- ,Moa-Hunters of NZ,12)

>  (Profesor Joan Metge) Recent letters opposing the use of the word `Pakeha' claim that it means `foreigner' or `stranger'. ... Whatever the word meant when it was first bestowed, it has taken on a new and special meaning. Maoris today use it to identify non-Maori New Zealanders of European and especially of British stock, people whom they recognise as having a history of residence and commitment to this country. Maoris use it not only to distinguish Pakehas from themselves but to couple them with themselves. The word has meaning only within the New Zealand context, in relation to and partnership with `Maori', the shared reference point being the land of Aotearoa/New Zealand.

So Maori was used as opposed to the Europeans, the white-skins. <i>Kuri Maori</i> was a name used for a dog after the arrival of other quadrupeds called also <i>kuri. Wai maori</i>was fresh-water, ordinary as opposed to sea-water. Another explanation is that the word meant `indigenous,' and that there are kindred words with that meaning in other Polynesian languages. First, `indigenous,' or "of the native race,' and then with a secondary meaning, `ours.' (See `Tregear's Maori Comparative Dictionary,' s.v.) The form of the plural varies, The form <i>Maoris</i> is considered the more correct, but the form <i>Maories</i> is frequently used by good writers. (1898 -- ,Austral English,284)

[ed 1961 fn.] This is one of the rare occasions in which the word "Maori', as meaning a `person of the native race', is used by the missionaries. But its use here as meaning `the language of the native race', would seem to indicate that it was not an unusual name, although the missionaries and other normally used `native' or `New Zealander'.

>  Security of tenure was needed before any scheme to resuscitate the citrus industry could be commenced with successful prospects. Recommendations were therefore made to enable one member of the family to have, by communal aggreement in the Native Land Court, a definite area of the land held within the <i>kopu tangata</i>. Consequent upon such an agreement the occupier was confirmed as the owner under Maori custom and became capable of pledging the freehold to the administration as security for financial and material advances.

>  <b>BEAGLEHOLE</b> Again, the word Maori for these [Otaki] people has taken on a secondary meaning when it is used as an adjective referring to any object that is broken, dilapidated, hard to use, or about which people are so casual that it does not function efficiently. Thus a `Maori' door is one on which the catch is broken or which fits so badly that it blows open in the wind. ... A `Maori' gate is always a weird contraption made of bits of wire, string, parts of an old iron bedstead - something so complicated that it defies the ingenuity of the non-expert either to open or close.

>  Maori used as an adjective synonymous with <i>native </i>except that it seems slightly contemptuous. We admire native bush, pasture or game; but Maori hens (woodhens), Maori cabbage [European cabbage run wild, A Wall] and Maori onion (Chrysobactron hookeri] are caricatures of their English namesales.

There are several trusts for various forms of Maori landholding - <i>ahi whenua trusts, kitiakai trusts, putea trusts, whanau trusts</i> and <i>whenua topu trusts</i>.

## marching
 
 <i>n.</i> women's formation marching as a competitive sport [It seems the trail leads back to Aucklandabout 1924 at earliest, first real exhibition probably 1926; competitions between various factories in the clothing trade. The restrictions on uniforms mentioned below were brought in to prevent big firms outspending the smallones by providing splendiferous uniforms. Organisations outside the rag trade do not seem to have been allowed in officially into Interhouse Marching until about 1954. Despite the evidence below that it started in Auckland under Jean Stevenson, Bateman's Encyclopedia says marching started in Wellington and spread to Auckland later. It must be wrong. The plot thickens. Passing through London Bookshop today I spotted Gordon Ell's new book on NZ Trivia and Kiwiana and he says Marching Girls started in Dunedin in the 1920s. have I found any early Auckland ones, nothing before 1941 in Wellington. guess is that one or other or both of Jean Stevenson and Kathleen Montgomery started them in Auckland and through the YWCA spread them rapidly throughout the main centres.]

## matai beer
 
<b>1</b> <i>n.</i> (Rural) a sappy liquid exuded by matai trees, possibly fermented. [ca1900 Marlborough bushmen.]

>  I dimly remember as a youngster in the days when the Forty-Mile Bush was still standing, such a drink as 'matai beer' was sometimes spoken of amongst bushmen. (Dec 10, 1920 -- ,Quick March,11)

>  <b>KERR</b> In New Zealand, Maori men knew that cracks in the heart-wood of old matai trees often exude a liquid, matai beer, a stimulating drink that weary white bushmen later discovered. (1976 -- ,From the Beginning: chronicles of a county,294)

>  <b>HUTT</b> Matai beer was described by a Taihape newspaper in 1912 as tasting "like used machine oil... When a deep swig is absorbed, one has all the sensations of having swallowed a lighted kerosene stove." (1999 -- ,Maori & Alcohol,14) [NOTES: see McKay <i>Puborama</i> 1961, p. 95]

>  ... I dimly remember as a youngster in the days when the Forty-Mile Bush was still standing, such a drink as `matai beer' was sometimes spoken of amongst bushmen. Apparently it was made from the sap of the matai tree, extracted by the simple process of boring an auger-hole in the trunk. ... Can any old-timer axeman give any information concerning this liquor. (Dec 10, 1920 -- ,Quick March,13)

>  When I was a boy I lived in Carterton, and that was in the 'sixties, when there was little else than bush there ... I have frequently drunk the matai beer which gushes out of the centre of the tree when the axemen get to the heart. The flavour varies, but always has something of the tang of resin about it, though it is not at all a bad drink. ... I never heard of this matai beer being intoxicating; ... (Feb 10, 1921 -- ,Quick March,13)

>  <b>MACKAY</b> In the rip-roaring times of the King Country, Matai beer was a favourite with those who were strong enough and tough enough to drink it. It went out of favour when `cruisers' for the various timber mills complained that much good yellow pine was being ruined through the number of deep axe cuts and even auger holes in the standing trees, made to let the potent juice run into waiting pannikins or buckets. The favourite recipe for this form of wood alcohol represented the addition of three or four cupsful of the sap to each gallon of `ordinary' liquid refreshment. That the resultant mixture had a pretty hefty kick to it may be judged from this description handed in to the Taihape newspaper (1912): `Matai beer is the term used to describe a certain brand or grade of alcoholic brew. It may be identified easily. It smells like an ancient bar room the morning after. It tastes like used machine oil, only a very low grade of machine oil. (1961 -- ,Puborama,95)

>  <b>OWEN & PERKINS</b> But [bushmen] used to make concoctions of their own, and the most popular ... was matai beer. ... When you felled a big matai, a really mature black pine ... you would see the main artery in the heart of the tree gushing out the life liquid. ... It wasn't the sap; this was not related to that. It was a pure clear liquid, and it gushed out like the main artery gushing blood. But that used to be prized, and it would be caught in a billy. That was really something. It was beautiful and cool and sweet to drink as it was, but some of the blokes used to bung in maybe a handful of raisins and sugar and cork her up and let her ferment, and whether that fluid had any other properties in it or not I don't know, but you could get quite a potent drink from it. (1986 -- ,Speaking for Ourselves,65) [NOTES: (Bob Edwards, bushman)]

>  <b>FULLER</b> MATAI BEER [title] I have been told by old bushmen and Maoris about making beer from the sap of the matai tree ... Apparently when the tree was being cut down the watery sap was collected, more water was added and also some ordinary beer, or yeast. It was left to ferment and was reputed to be quite strong though I have not been able to find any written evidence of this. (1978 -- ,Maori Food and Cookery,83)

## Matariki
 
 <i>n.</i> (Te Matariki) the Pleiades, the heliacal rising of which in early winter marks the Maori New Year. [Jim writes: now an occasional celebration by urban as well as rural Maori. Known to me from posters etc. Not in DNZE.]

>  One whakatauki, or proverb, describes this time as Matariki ahunga nui: Matariki, provider of plentiful food... Matariki marked a turning point in the gardening year... The appearance of Matariki is auspicious for predicting the coming year's harvests. (Jun 5, 2004 -- ,Dominion,E17)

>  The Maori new year started on June 23, after the first new moon following since the yearly reappearance above the horizon before dawn of the Pleiades star cluster (Maori : Matariki). (Dec 17, 2001 -- ,Evening Post,7)

>  My apologies.. if I did not make it sufficiently clear in describing Matariki that the celebration of a New Year marked by the winter solstice is the "tradition" that links it with Hogmanay and the Saturnalia. It did not occur to me that this might be misconstrued as a suggestion that Maori had been celebrating Matariki here for millennia. (Jul 12, 2003 -- ,Listener (New Zealand Listener),9)

>  Matariki is a time for harvesting and Thornley says it is a good time to gather herbs from the bush... "It's a good time to pick pikopiko. Matariki is a time for putting the past to rest and looking forward to the future." (Jun 25, 2003 -- ,Capital Times,18)

>  Winter might not be the easiest time of the year to rise before dawn, but it's the only chance to see Matariki, a cluster of stars that heralds the Maori New Year... Matariki is celebrated differently by each iwi,. but the New Year begins with the first new moon after the appearance of Matariki. (May 27, 2004 -- ,Wellington Contact,1)

>  Towards the end of May each year the constellation Matariki, also known as the Pleiades, rises on the north-east horizon around half an hour before dawn. (Aug 2001 -- ,Absolutely Positively Wellington,10)

>  [Hdg] Matariki celebrations continue at Te Papa... In the last week of May, the star cluster Matariki, or Pleiades, appears in our dawn sky. For most iwi, the Maori New year begins with the first new moon after the appearance of Matariki. (Jun 14, 2001 -- ,City Voice,4)

>  <b>PARK</b> At Te Kuiti I never saw the Pleiades because of the hills. Years afterwards, when I lived on the broad plains, I saw that heliacal rising, a handful of sparks on the horizon, until the sun blew them out. Mr Tawhai called them Te Matariki. (1992 -- ,Fence Around the Cuckoo,70)

>  But what is Matariki and why has this ancient tradition, which hasn't been much practised by Maori for the past 150 years, suddenly taken off again? Matariki is the Maori name for the beautiful little cluster of stars that is commonly known as the Pleiades or the Seven Sisters, Roughly translated, it means "little-eyes".... At the end of May, Matariki reappears in the morning sky, rising just before dawn... So Matariki is linked to the universal celebration of midwinter. It's the antipodean equivalent of the Scots' hogmanay or the Chinese New Year - in fact it has traditions that go back further than the Roman Saturnalia.

>  <b>McDONNELL</b> I certainly have never been able to discover any great difference in the conduct of the converted and the unconverted - if any difference really exists, it seems by general consent to be given in favor of the latter - indeed, the word Missionaries is used by the Europeans here only to distinguish those rogues, for whose superior rascallity we have no other sufficiently comprehensive term in our language. The fact is, they are all whether converted or unconverted, radically bad - and it is my own opinion as well as that of every one else whom I have conversed with on the subject, that no permanent good can be done among them until they are placed under a power, which shall be at once their terror, their protection, and their model.

>  <b>DUFF</b> THE [AUTHOR'S] USE OF THE TERM MOA-HUNTER [heading] [XII] ... Because this hunting economy and imported artifact styles coincided with the then unknown period of the extermination of the Moa in particular, Skinner, Duff and Buck revived the term Moa-hunter Maori to distinguish the first phase of ecological adaptation from the climax Classic Maori phase of the eighteenth century, with such new elements as agriculture, the fortified village, warfare, and artifact styles evolved within New Zealand. [XII] The term Moa-hunter follows the practice in culture-phase designation of coining a label of contrast. Although Moa-hunter Maoris gathered shell-fish and hunted all available birds, fish, seals and small whales, the cultural and economic phase is conveniently designated from the Moa as the largest and most spectacular game animal available during man's first adaptation to the environment and the one no longer available in the Classic Maori era. The term Moa-hunter is preferred here to the longer `Archaic Phase of New Zealand East Polynesian', too easily corrupted to `Archaic Maori', with `Archaic' meaning only `early'.

## Moeraki Boulders
 
 <i>n.</i> (in North Otago)

>  The Moeraki boulders are an assemblage of near-perfect spheres that lie like discarded cricket balls on an east Otago beach. The largest of them span more than two metres in diameter and weigh over seven tonnes.[15] Claims have been made that the Moeraki boulders are the only rocks of their kind in the world... The truth is that concretions are common, but are usually only a few centimetres in diameter, irregular in shape and unlikely to impress... To Moeraki's Ngai Tahi residents, the boulders' origin is intertwined with the arrival of kumara from distant Hawaiki. According to Te Rungana o Moeraki, the great waka Arai-Te-Uru was wrecked during a fierce storm at Matakaea (Shag Point), just south of Moeraki. The boulders are food baskets that washed ashore after being thrown overboard to lighten the load. The Katiki concretions are said to be kumara tubers and seeds from the same wreck.

 <i>n.</i> 1952 Feb 16 R.Gilberd notes on Mongrel Reading `Talking of Words' (Cecil Hull) p21`We might objectively and scientifically describe him, if he were ours, as a dog of mixed breeds - ... we would not be pleased if an acquaintance calls that dog a mongrel.' In town where dogs are kept largely for appearance and display `mongrel' I think has only one meaning - that a dog is of mixed breeding (with a note of disapproval or contempt). In the country mongrel has two independent meanings. (i) A dog of mixed blood. Objective - no emotional content. Indeed `pedigreed' is acquiring something of the mongrel taint, in that if a good dog has a pedigree it is mentioned with a faint note of surprise. (ii) A `no-good' whether man or animal. `He turned out mongrel' (Rod Macaulay speaking of a pedigreed mastiff that took to sheep worrying.) `When Bill brought him home I knew he'd turn out a mongrel. Sort of a cow-y look about his head.' (Walter Hull discussing a pedigreed `Totara Park' Friesian bull which proved sterile.) Talking of dogs: An `eye-dog' is a specialised type of header which works very quietly, never taking its eyes off the sheep it is trying to pen. Sheep men generally seem to think the dog hypnotises the sheep into being penned quietly. I believe that the fixity of its gaze and its complete concentration enable it to detect and counter any rebelliousness on the part of the sheep before the sheep have quite made up their minds.

When the cake reached the required thickness the basket was lifted and placed in a tank of barren cyanide solution, which was sucked through the cake removing the residual gold-bearing solution. After this the basket was placed in a `wash water' tank to remove all the solution, and then it was lifted and placed over the discharge bay; the vacuum was then released, allowing the cake to fall off (with some encouragement from a wooden scraper) into a waste sluice. [328] This process was repeated at about two-hourly intervals, with several bays working at the same time. (1978 -- ,Gold Mining at Waihi (Glossary),327)

>  <b>MORRIS</b> <i>Mopoke, n.</i> aboriginal name for an Australian bird, from its note `Mopoke.' There is emphasis on the first syllable, but much more on the second.

The r sound, however, is not present in the note of the bird, although the form <i>More-pork</i> is perhaps even more popular than the true form <i>Mope-hawk</i> seems to have been adopted through dislike of the perhaps coarser idea attaching to `pork.' The quaint spelling <i>Mawpawk</i> seems to have been adopted for a similar reason. [1827 Tasmania] (1898 -- ,Austral English,301)

>  <b>WISNIOWSKI</b> This passage embodies an early version of what has become known as the `Moriori myth'. Except for the name Moriori, which was borrowed from the Chatham Islands and applied by 1880 to supposed pre-Maori inhabitants of New Zealand, the theory is all here in a book published in 1877, based on material collected in the mid-1860s. A black-skinned, curly-headed people with timid dispositions, presumably negroid or Melanesian, were supposed to have been found in possession of New Zealand by the first Polynesian settlers and exterminated by them except for a few with whom they intermarried, so that their racial traits appeared from time to time among the Maoris.

>  Under his tutelage New Zealand learned to live beyond its means as it had never done before, to such an extent that nobody seems to know quite how large its total foreign debt has become, except that it is certainly huge and may be a per capita world record. Its welfare state, which has often been held up as an example to the world, was allowed to swell as its traditional and all-important agricultural markets shrank.

>  <b>McLINTOCK</b> MUTTONBIRD. Also known as the sooty shearwater or titi, the New Zealand muttonbird is <i>Puffinus griseus</i> and belongs to the order of sea birds known as petrels. As a name, `muttonbird' appears to have originated among early European settlers in Australasia and is said to refer to the taste of the flesh. At least as probable is the theory that the name refers to the rather woolly appearance of the downy young. In New Zealand other petrels are also given the name `muttonbird'. In fact, the sooty shearwater, which is most abundant on the islands about Foveaux Strait, might well be called the <i>southern</i> muttonbird, and the grey-faced petrel, predominant on the islands off the coast of Auckland Province,the <i>northern</i> muttonbird. In Victoria, Tasmania, Bass Strait, and South Australia, the species is the short-tailed shearwater - an occasional visitor to New Zealand seas. (1966 -- ,Encyclopaedia of New Zealand, An,2/616)
