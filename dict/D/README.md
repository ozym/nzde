The removal of dags from the hind-quarters of sheep is a seasonal operation usually called `crutching.' Used personally, `dag' was earlier a term of some approbation.

## deer track
 
 <i>n.</i> [(deer shooters')]

>  <b>Sep 1958</b> In recent years there seems to have been a tendency to use both track and trail and to differentiate between them. A trail seems to be something narrow and perhaps rather hardto follow - a way marked only by blazes or worn by animals, usually deer. A track seems to be something broader, cut or formed by man. ... A well-known older Club member made this distinction when, on hearing him speak of a deer trail, I asked him what he thought to be the difference between track and trail. I remarked that I thought it a very recent distinction, one not occurring in the Club until about 1957. He disagreed, believing it to be one he had always known. Yet, on looking through The Tramper, I could not find deer trail used until 1944, but deer track occurs from the first number in 1928 onwards, and he himself had used it in 1940. It remains to be seen whether this distinction will become established. In the meantime deer track still seems to be used far more than deer trail.

But there are also legends that.. there were always many seamen about, sometimes unemployed, and all of them were accompanied by their dogs.

Sometimes men on contract, trying to save timber, place their saw-cut too low and some of the wood-fibres break off up in the barrel. These are `stringers' while they are breaking, and `slivers' or `drawers' when they are left upright in the sloven. (Letter) [NOTES: (Northland)]

>  <b>1953</b> <i>REED</i> A `draw' was a serious defect, but was not due to any fault in the living tree. When a tree fell before it was quite severed, it sometimes, in the act of falling, wrenched or `drew' out a portion of the butt, leaving great jagged, fang-like splinters adhering to the stump. The damage was, of course, always to the heart wood ... [<i>Ibid.</i> 156 [Edward Thompson] ... very often, before the saw got within a foot or so of the front scarf, the tree would start to fall gradually, and the uncut timber between the saw and the front scarf would have to break, and seldom cleanly; the heart, being more brittle than the sap, would break here and there, several feet above where thesawcut would have been standing straight. As the tree fell, these pieces, still attached to the stump, would draw out of the tree, and being almost heart-wood constituted the chief defect we call `draws'.

The noise of a fall or drive of this kind is like thunder - loud, prolonged, reverberating. <i>Ibid..</i> 94 Harry had planned a big drive with a combined rimu and rata ... had `scarfed' all the smaller trees in front of it down to the already felled bush, and expected, when it was brought down, that it would send to earth the whole of these, driving one upon another far beyond the reach of its own length ...

>  <b>1972</b> <i>NEWTON</i> He had seen as many as twenty-four men in a single [professional bushfalling] gang and they worked `drives' of up to five acres and more [in the King Country]. (Wake of The Axe,117)

>  <b>1986</b> <i>RICHARDS</i> It was quite a common practice for experienced bushmen, to have a `drive'. If you are chopping up a `face' and there is a large tree behind you further up the face, you select that as the `key'. To save time ... you do not waste time by chopping down each tree individually, but just `scarf' and partly chop each tree. When all is ready and you have worked back to the key, you scarf it verycarefully. ... If everything goes according to plan it will `drive' the one below, which will in turn drive the next, and so on ... (Off the Sheep's Back,22)

>  <b>1955</b> <i>WILSON</i> A `drive' was in progress; as the men do the underscrubbing they note the large trees and their distance from each other. They scarf each one so that it will fall on the next. Then, after all the smaller timber has been brought down, they fell the first tree which falls on the second and so starts a whole sequence of crashes. The line need not be straight. More often, it zig-zags from right to left. Bushmen can do wonders by means of an ingenious drive. (Land of My Children,11)

(Massey - Its Early Years,87)

He was [87 years old.] Dr Dye was born in Driffield, Yorkshire, and educated at Bridlington School and Leeds University from which he graduated in 1925 as a Doctor of Science. He came to New Zealand in 1929 to be a lecturer at the newly-founded Massey Agricultural College. Shortly after his arrival Dr Dry discovered a ram lamb in a flock near Palmerston North which had an extremely hairy fleece due to an abundance of halo-hairs. Dr Dry's successful efforts to isolate the gene in Romney led to the development of the Drysdale. Dr Dry devoted nearly 40 years studying the genetic makeup of the fleece of the sheep and published many papers.
