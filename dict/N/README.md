Unlike a forest, a park is enclosed, and [31] it does not have special laws or offices. In all the uses to which park has been put in England, until the recent adoption of National Park, there has been the idea of enclosure, as there is in the cognate paddock. The term forest park, as in the Tararua Forest Park, would once have seemed a contradiction in terms. (Sep 1958 -- ,Tararua,30) [NOTES: Ruth Mason `Track and Trail']

## Native
 
 <i>n.</i> Applied to Maori people and their concerns. a. The synonym Aborigine(q.v.) was used very early as a term familiar to the Colonial Office (and perhaps to missionary organisations as the Church Missionary Society) and had some currency from the offical name and office `Protector of Aborigines'. See also Cook's (and early explorer's) indian. b. native preceded Maori q.v. in common use in early journals and accounts. (eg Markham, Polack etc) the latter being first used (as perhaps native was) as an adjective, and its frequency was (until the 1850's or 1860's) matched only by the use of New Zealand and New Zealander (especially the latter as a noun) for `Maori'. -->[Discuss usage in eg. Markham, Williams, McLean etc.] In Richmond - Atkinson papers Maori seems to be the main personal usage of the correspondents except for H. Atkinson who uses negro, nigger in private correspondence.

(Aug 28, 1873 -- ,Diary,102,1853 ed.)

>  <b>PAYTON</b> It is always the custom in New Zealand, especially in the North Island, to use Maori words frequently in referring to the natives and their doings; a colonist would no more dream of calling a Maori whare `a house,' or a tangi `a ceremony of weeping' than he ...

We don't like having a Native Department, or Native schools, or a Native Land Court, or a Native Minister. We like to be called Maori. We're proud of being Maori, not natives.'

>  Temple rightly notes Dieffenbach's enlightened perception of the Maori as the first inhabitants with fundamental rights, and not inferior, intellectually and morally, to the invading European. But he labours the point in seeing evidence of this in Dieffenbach's reference to them as `New Zealanders, by implication the true inhabitants of the country, when the terms Maori and Native were become synonymous and implied that they were inferior to the intellectual and moral superiority of white, especially British, races'. At the time, `New Zealanders' was commonly used (eg The New Zealanders Illustrated by G F Angas, 1847) while the term `native', meaning `native to the place' without the depressed sense it was later to acquire, was also used freely by Dieffenbach.

 <i>adj.</i> Used within New Zealand, in competition with the more specific New Zealand, Maori to denote especially fauna (including human fauna) and flora considered indigenous. It is now (1984) anobsolescent or non-preferred use, chiefly because of the felt derogatory application to people and things Maori (cf the change in 1947 from Department of `Native Affairs' to `Maori Affairs', and such shifts as native earth oven amended to earth oven between the sixth (1957) and seventh (1971) editions of Williams Dictionary (Umu 1 p467); and also of greater feeling of identity among born New Zealanders expressing itself in a more specific descriptive term `New Zealand'. (Shifts such as native bush to indigenous forest are an example of vernacular or common as against technical or `professional' forestry usage: the latter being the converse of exotic forest.) The New Zealand non-specificity of native can be seen in its Australian applications (see Morris), and is illustrated by OED 13c. `In the names of Australian animals and birds in the names of Australian plants, fruits, etc.' [J.A. Andersen's comments (`Popular Names of New Zealand Plants': 1926 Tr NZI 662) still hold: `The word `native' has been prefixed to almost as many names as the words `New Zealand .... This word may perhaps be descriptive if used within New Zealand and between New Zealanders; but if used outside - say in Australia - its meaning will be quite changed; for should the New Zealander speak of `native teak' the Australian would think not of a New Zealand but of an Australian tree. The confusion might be avoided were the word `Maori' used instead of the word `native', and indeed, instead of the long double `New Zealand'. See also 1933 Acland's note on indigenous. Usage is separated below into 1. general and 2. specific applications. 1.]

## neenish tart
 
 <i>n.</i> [A small round short-pastry tart with a custard filling but especially characterised by the icing, half of which is black and half white; in Dunedin with a peppermint flavour (check). Other variations in the filling include lemon juice, rum essence or vanilla. Known to me from Dunedin in 1952. An Australian version (see below) is on a biscuit base instead of being in a tart and includes a layer of jam but has the essential bicoloured icing. Possible origins of the name : Nimes (in France); Neen in Shropshire (Neenton, Neen Savage, Neen Sollars); have been told of a Dutch woman making them. There is an outside chance it might be related to the neem tree ("a meliaceous tree of India and Ceylon, sometimes 50 feet high... The natives chew its small twigs and use them as tooth brushes") but I think not. David Burton does not mention them in his books on the raj. Kathryn Walls knows the lemon-flavoured variety from Invercargill (thought they were bakery rather than home-made), Vincent had heard of them, Bill Manhire hadn't. Nelson Wattie does not know them from NZ but when the bicoloured icing was described said he knew them from Germany as "Americans", possibly because of the black and white racial suggestion. Tony Simpson makes, them, his mother made them, his grandmother made them, but he doesn't know anything about the origin. The name appears as a headword in the Macquarie Dictionary but none other that I can find. None of the books on the cookery shelves at National Library has them, not do any of the present stock of second-hand ones in Quilter's but then most modern cookery books are written (or compiled) by restaurant chefs who do not bake and not by bakery cooks.]

>  I am - a New Chum. My business is to critcise, moralise upon, compare, sketch, and, where necessary, correct or praise the peculiarities of my adopted countrymen. First, then, arises this question: what is a 'New Chum'? and it may be answered in two ways, according to the manner in which it is asked. For there is a real New Chum; and there is a New Chum that is ideal only. The New Chum proper, is, I understand, a person who has but freshly come to the Colony from some part or other of the old world. The New chum that most colonists, here, appear to have in their mind's eye, is quite a different being in most cases. He is a pattern of neatness and elegance in his dress; of cheek and superciliousness in his deportment; of ignorance, meanness, cowardice, spiritlessness, vagueness, helplessness in time of emergency, vanity, presumption, and emptiness, in his temperament; and of all these vices, combined with effeminate and pedantic precision, in his talk. His delight is to abuse colonial customs; to run down the local 'bigwigs'; to show contempt for the industries and pursuits of the colonists generally; and affect a languid indifference to the matters which most engage their interest. His purse is even emptier than his head. He is without resources and without pluck. His ambition is at once low and unreasonable. he puts his trust in letters of introduction, and looks for a Government billet. (Aug 30, 1871 -- ,Timaru Herald,6)

>  New Zealand is divided into two provinces, New Ulster, and New Munster, each of which is under a Lieutenant-Governor, who enacts ordinances for the province over which he presides, with the advice of a Legislative Council, composed of the officers of Government, together with a few persons nominated by the crown from amongst the inhabitants. A Governor-in-Chief rules the whole of New Zealand and is assisted in his legislation by a Council constituted similarly to the provincial Councils. At present, the Governor-in-Chief holds the subordinate office of Lieutenant-Governor of New Ulster , in addition to his higher Commission: and Mr Eyre is the Lieutenant of New Munster, the southern province. (Feb 1, 1851 -- ,Lyttelton Times,2)

>  <b>THOMSON</b> Of the three islands forming the Zealand group, Rakiura, or the small South Island, is the only one which possesses a native name. Since the days of Cook, the North Island has been named on old maps Eaheinomawe, and the Middle Island Tavai-poenammo. These names originated thus. When the great navigator asked the natives the name of the North Island, he was told that it was `a thing fished from the sea by Maui,' - He mea hi no Maui; and that the Middle Island was Te wahi pounamu, or `the place of the greenstone.' When New Zealand became a British colony, the first governor, who was an Irishman, proclaimed that the North, Middle, and South Island were thenceforth to be denominated respectively New Ulster, New Munster, and New Leinster; and these names he selected for the colony because New Zealand, like Irelands, had no toads. This modern method of naming places by applying the epithet `New' to countries which are as old as the originals is not only incorrect, but possesses many disadvantages. The Constitution Act of 1852 discarded this unsuitable nomenclature, and the North, Middle, and Stewart's Islands are the names now invariably given to them by the settlers, and those by which they are familiar toseamen. The South Island was named in honour of the sealer who, in 1808, discovered its insularity. Sentimental settlers designate New Zealand the Britain of the southern hemisphere, on the same principle that the Dutchman Tasman, who discovered the country, called it New Zealand.

After 1870, most Maori referred to the country as Niu Tirani - a result of Pakeha settlers calling the three islands New Zealand. Sir Keith said that in all the written Maori he had read from last century the word Aotearoa had been used in only one newspaper. Te Wanaanga, published in Napier, used Aotearoa in the 1870s. Sir Keith said Maori often referred to New Zealand by using `te motu nei' (in this island). Sir Keith said the literal translation of Aotearoa was `land of the long twilight'. The name may have come about because the early Polynesians were not used to the long evenings in New Zealand. (Jul 17, 1988 -- ,Sunday Star Times,A6)

>  <b>COWAN</b> There is at least one sense, however, in which Cowan can be said to be ahead of his time. He steadfastly clung to the term `New Zealand Wars'. He rejected the more popular but misleadingexpression `Maori Wars', which implied that Maoris alone were responsible for the outbreaks of conflict. From the 1960s historians have explored more neutral and more accurate terms to characterise the period. Some opted for `Land Wars', but this is not entirely satisfactory because issues were involved in addition to that of land. Others suggested `Anglo-Maori Wars' but this too is less than adequate; the English were not the only Europeans involved and. as already noted, Maoris fought on both sides. For this latter reason `Maori-Pakeha Wars' is also unsuitable. ... If they are referred to as the New Zealand Wars they cannot be confused with any others, particularly if earlier actions involving Maoris alone are designated `tribal wars'.

But they would endeavour to sing in the Maori tongue `For he's a jolly good fellow.' Led by Mr. Bray, the New Zealanders then sang `For he's a jolly good fellow ' with much effect. They then gave the `New Zealand Whisper' for the ladies, after which `God Save the King' was sung by all present, Mr. Naylor (of St. George's Chapel Choir ) leading. Three cheers were next given for the visitors, finishing with an `English whisper' for the New Zealand ladies. A most enjoyable time then terminated with all joining in `Auld Lang Syne'.

>  Prior to the arrival of European navigators such as Abel Tasman, Captain Cook and De Surville, the indigenous people of New Zealand had no one word for themselves as an ethnic group. Instead, they were known by their tribal names of Tuhoe, Ngapuhi, Ngati Porou, etc. For recording purposes this was too cumbersome, so in their writings the navigators referred to the inhabitants of the country as New Zealanders. The closest concept the people had for such an all-encompassing label was tangata whenua, people of the land. But this did not come into general use until later as it had a more specific meaning in tribal relations between hosts and guests. (May 14, 1990 -- ,Listener (New Zealand Listener),100)

>  I observed that the term `New Zealander' is already employed in this district; only, in lieu of `Noui-Tireni", as the natives of the Bay of Islands pronounce it, they say `Noui-Tirangui' [NuiTirangi] [sic], which gives the word more of an indigenous sound. The word pakeha serves themto signify all whites, whom they also call `Iouropi' (Europeans). I did not observe that they had a special name for the English.

>  <b>MORRIS</b> ~ a lump of gold. The noun nugget is not Australian, though often so supposed. Skeat (`Etymological Dictionary,' s.v.) gives a quotation from North's `Plutarch' with the word in a slightly different shape, viz., niggot. `The word nugget was in use in Australia many years before the goldfields were heard of. A thick-set young beast was called `a good nugget.' A bit of a fig of tobacco was called a nugget of tobacco .'' (G. W. Rusden.) [1852] (1898 -- ,Austral English,323)

>  Stray notes on Australia and the Diggings (Griffiths Collection) Origin of he word `Nugget'. - This word, now so common amongst our population, is a strange sounding word, and destitute of any apparent entymological meaning. It originated at the Ophir diggings in New South Wales, and is probably a corruption of `ingot', which is itself a corruption of `lingot', a little tongue. The wedge of gold which Achan purloined is called, in the original Hebrew, a `tongue' of gold, as a reference to a Bible with marginal readings will show. In California, the word `lump' is generally used, and sometimes the Spanish word `pepite.' (Sep 30, 1852 -- ,Leisure Hour, The,640)

>  <b>A S THOMSON</b> In November [1852] I visited the diggings [at Thames], and procured the frog which is herewith sent. [221] It was got in this way. The gold-diggers were washing the soil of a mountain-stream in the machine called `long-tom'. In excavating the banks they displaced several large boulders of quartzy rock, underneath which was discovered the living frog. The gold-diggers, who voluntarily submit to the evils and miseries of such a gambling trade, and can rarely be excited by anything unless a great nugget, were so much astonished at the sight of a frog that one of them desisted fom the seductive occupation he was at, and took the frog, and put it into a bottle of water.

Eric Partridge in his A Dictionary of Slang gives it as Australian colloquial from about 1910 - the date he thought he first remembered it from. I have it in my collections, but have no early date for it as I have not yet checked it up in advertisements of old newspapers, nor written to the company that produces it to ask them when they adopted Nugget as a brand-name, and why. I assume it comes from nugget `a small lump', as in nugget of gold. Perhaps you or the class might like to write to the Nugget company and ask them about this. It's also now used as a verb - `to nugget shoes ', for example. It's like many other brand-names that have passed into common speech: e.g. hoover for `vacuum cleaner': to hoover a room, etc.]
