## Native


 n. Applied to Maori people and their concerns. a. The synonym Aborigine(q.v.) was used very early as a term familiar to the Colonial Office (and perhaps to missionary organisations as the Church Missionary Society) and had some currency from the offical name and office `Protector of Aborigines'. See also Cook's (and early explorer's) indian. b. native preceded Maori q.v. in common use in early journals and accounts. (eg Markham, Polack etc) the latter being first used (as perhaps native was) as an adjective, and its frequency was (until the 1850's or 1860's) matched only by the use of New Zealand and New Zealander (especially the latter as a noun) for `Maori'. -->[Discuss usage in eg. Markham, Williams, McLean etc.] In Richmond - Atkinson papers Maori seems to be the main personal usage of the correspondents except for H. Atkinson who uses negro, nigger in private correspondence. Abusive early synonyms: see black, nigger, later hori.
 n. a Moriori
 adj. Used within New Zealand, in competition with the more specific New Zealand, Maori to denote especially fauna (including human fauna) and flora considered indigenous. It is now (1984) anobsolescent or non-preferred use, chiefly because of the felt derogatory application to people and things Maori (cf the change in 1947 from Department of `Native Affairs' to `Maori Affairs', and such shifts as native earth oven amended to earth oven between the sixth (1957) and seventh (1971) editions of Williams Dictionary (Umu 1 p467); and also of greater feeling of identity among born New Zealanders expressing itself in a more specific descriptive term `New Zealand'. (Shifts such as native bush to indigenous forest are an example of vernacular or common as against technical or `professional' forestry usage: the latter being the converse of exotic forest.) The New Zealand non-specificity of native can be seen in its Australian applications (see Morris), and is illustrated by OED 13c. `In the names of Australian animals and birds in the names of Australian plants, fruits, etc.' [J.A. Andersen's comments (`Popular Names of New Zealand Plants': 1926 Tr NZI 662) still hold: `The word `native' has been prefixed to almost as many names as the words `New Zealand .... This word may perhaps be descriptive if used within New Zealand and between New Zealanders; but if used outside - say in Australia - its meaning will be quite changed; for should the New Zealander speak of `native teak' the Australian would think not of a New Zealand but of an Australian tree. The confusion might be avoided were the word `Maori' used instead of the word `native', and indeed, instead of the long double `New Zealand'. See also 1933 Acland's note on indigenous. Usage is separated below into 1. general and 2. specific applications. 1.]
 n. [the Colony being NSW?]
 n. the Maori language
 n. a Maori [Native n and aj. remained in official use until 1947. (Cf R. Mason's note, 1953.) The term `Native' in `Native Minister', `Native Department' etc. was dropped during the war in favour of `Maori'. I understand in deference to opinion of B.B.C. who found native `a term much disliked in India etc. & wished to avoid it in broadcasts. Native schools now Maori schools')]

Lots of confusion, popular use masquerading as official and confused official use; am working my way through but have to go back to Turnbull where a helpful young lady produced as I was leaving the NZ Almanacks which seem to be the ONLY source of official titles. Will chase them up further. People in Hansard use very loose terminology and there is no official listing of Ministers in Hansard. The following is my best effort from the Wellington Almanack (and others): 1822-1850 No record. 1851 Commissioner for acquiring the Cession of Lands from the Natives: - Donald McLean. 1851 Native Secretary H. Tacy Kemp GBP200 per annum [in addition to above]. 1852 Native Secretary [from Estimates]. 1853 Native Secretary Native Secretary's Department [from Estimates]. 1855 Native Secretary's Department [from Estimates]. 1857 Native Secretary - D. McLean. 1858 AJHR E-No.1/17 Donald McLean, Native Secretary, writes from Native Secretary's Office, 28 June 1858. 1860 Native Secretary's Department. 1861 Minister for Native Affairs - Honourable C.W. Richmond Native Secretary's Office. 1862 Minister for Native Affairs - F.D. Bell (Acting) Native Secretary's Department OR Native Department. 1863 Native Minister - F.D. Bell Native Land Purchase Department - Crown Commissioner .. D.McLean Native Secretary's Department - Native Secretary D. McLean NOTE; This is the first time the big three Ministers are joined by a new portfolio. 1864 Minister for Native Affairs - Honourable William Fox Native Secretary's Department. 1866 Native Minister - Honorable A.H. Russell Native Department - Minister for Native Affairs - Honorable A.H. Russell. 1867 Native Minister - Honorable J.C. Richmond Native Department - Minister for Native Affairs. 1868 Native Department - Under Secretary W. Rolleston. 1870 Ministry has now become Cabinet Donald McLean, Minister for Colonial Defence and Native Affairs. 1873 Honorable Donald McLean, Native Minister. 1878 Native Minister & Minister of Justice. 1879 Native and Defence Office Native Minister. 1880 Honorable John Boyce, Minister for Native Affairs Native Office. 1885 Native and Defence Minister Native Office. 1888 Minister of Public Works and Native Affairs. I gave up about here. Basically, you can take your pick.]

There will undoubtedly be more colloquial references in second readings to bills.

 n. (historical) the New Zealand language (Maori)
 adj. As an attributive from the Country's name, it had in very early times, a connotation NATIVE, MAORI (cf NEW ZEALANDER) often with suggestions of roughness, wildness, or barbarism. It was quickly adapted (see 1840 entry) to include the white settlers and the civilised homeland they were preparing, a sense and use which obliterated the earlier. Many uses (eg New Zealand Company (1839), New Zealand Gazette) were merely defining, and had, of themselves, no racial reference.

## neenish tart


 n. [A small round short-pastry tart with a custard filling but especially characterised by the icing, half of which is black and half white; in Dunedin with a peppermint flavour (check). Other variations in the filling include lemon juice, rum essence or vanilla. Known to me from Dunedin in 1952. An Australian version (see below) is on a biscuit base instead of being in a tart and includes a layer of jam but has the essential bicoloured icing. Possible origins of the name : Nimes (in France); Neen in Shropshire (Neenton, Neen Savage, Neen Sollars); have been told of a Dutch woman making them. There is an outside chance it might be related to the neem tree ("a meliaceous tree of India and Ceylon, sometimes 50 feet high... The natives chew its small twigs and use them as tooth brushes") but I think not. David Burton does not mention them in his books on the raj. Kathryn Walls knows the lemon-flavoured variety from Invercargill (thought they were bakery rather than home-made), Vincent had heard of them, Bill Manhire hadn't. Nelson Wattie does not know them from NZ but when the bicoloured icing was described said he knew them from Germany as "Americans", possibly because of the black and white racial suggestion. Tony Simpson makes, them, his mother made them, his grandmother made them, but he doesn't know anything about the origin. The name appears as a headword in the Macquarie Dictionary but none other that I can find. None of the books on the cookery shelves at National Library has them, not do any of the present stock of second-hand ones in Quilter's but then most modern cookery books are written (or compiled) by restaurant chefs who do not bake and not by bakery cooks.]

 v. to apply boot polish to; to blacken with `Nugget'
 n. a boot polish (from trademark), usually thought of as black; now any bootpolish; [1984 Orsman letter to an enquirer Nugget `boot polish' is a New Zealand and Australian word used, I think, from before the First World War. Eric Partridge in his A Dictionary of Slang gives it as Australian colloquial from about 1910 - the date he thought he first remembered it from. I have it in my collections, but have no early date for it as I have not yet checked it up in advertisements of old newspapers, nor written to the company that produces it to ask them when they adopted Nugget as a brand-name, and why. I assume it comes from nugget `a small lump', as in nugget of gold. Perhaps you or the class might like to write to the Nugget company and ask them about this. It's also now used as a verb - `to nugget shoes ', for example. It's like many other brand-names that have passed into common speech: e.g. hoover for `vacuum cleaner': to hoover a room, etc.]
