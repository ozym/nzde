>  Rangatiratanga is a collective concept. You can't sell your rangatiratanga. In the Treaty of Waitangi, the word "rangatiratanga" appears in article 2.

Kawanatanga is subject to a promise to protect Rangatiratanga. Rangatiratanga is subject to an acknowledgment of Kawanatanga. The working out in practice of the balance between the two Articles must depend upon a case by case consideration. ... It is the right of all citizens, Maori, Pakeha, and other New Zealanders, that there be effective Government or Kawanatanga in such matters. (1989 -- ,Principles for Crown Action,7)

>  <b>KIRK</b> It is invariably erect and never climbing, although bushmen and settlers frequently state that it climbs the loftiest trees, and sooner or later squeezes them to death in its iron clasp. In proof of this they assert that, when felling huge ratas, they often find a dead tree in the centre of the rata: this is a common occurrence, but it by no means follows that this species is a climber. The error is simply due to imperfect observation, which has led careless observers to confuse [<i>M. scandens</i> the Aka], which is a true climber with <i>M. robusta</i>.

>  <b>MORRIS</b> <i>Rata, n.</i> Maori name for two New Zealand erect or sub-scandent flowering trees, often embracing trunks of forest trees and strangling them: the Northern Rata, <i> Metrosideros robusta </i> , A. Cunn., and the Southern Rata, <i> M. lucida </i> , Menz., both of the N.O. <i> Myrtacea </i> . The tree called by the Maoris Aka, which is another species of <i> Metrosideros (M. florida)</i> , is also often confused with the Rata by bushmen and settlers. In Maori, the adj. <i> rata </i> means red-hot, and there may be a reference to the scarlet appearance of the flower in full bloom. The timber of the Rata is often known as <i> Ironwood </i> , or <i> Ironbark </i> . The trees rise to sixty feet in height; they generally begin by trailing downwards from the seed deposited on the bark of some other tree near its top. When the trailing branches reach the ground they take root there and sprout erect. For full account of the habit of the trees, see quotation 1867 (Hochstetter), 1879 (Moseley), and 1889 (Kirk).

Moloney, he would gather rauriki and get his wife to cook it, for he enjoyed it years ago in Maori cooking, in the King Country, where it was called by the pakeha `Maori cabbage.' <i> Rauriki </i> is the common succulent thistle, growing 2ft to 3ft high, that the children gathering it for pet rabbits and guinea pigs, call milk thistle, because of the abundant flow of milky white sap from it. Actually there are two species' Sonchus oleraceus, whose lobed leaves are only mildly prickly and flat, or at the most very slightly waved at the edges, and S. asper, very similar except that the leaves are much more prickly, and are waved or crimped around the edges. The flowers are yellow, rather like those of a dandelion, about three-quarters of an inch in diameter. <i> Chewing Gum </i> According to some people, rauriki is the Maori name of the former and puwha of the latter, but I do not know that the Maoris went in for such nice distinctions. Different tribes had different names for the same thing. Puwha, as well as being one of the names for the sow thistle, seems to have been also used sometimes as a general term for any cooked greens, of which sow thistle was the favourite. (Jan 7, 1963 -- ,Otago Star) [NOTES: (I.W.T. Munro on `Maori Cabbage')]

>  At Oxford, Makereti (Maggie Papakura) wrote: `I myself gather the sow thistle here and cook it to eat, as it reminds me of our own puwha, of which I am very fond. Puwha was used only as a vegetable ... The succulent stems contained a bitter milky juice which came to the surface when the flower tops were plucked off. This was left, on a sunny day, for a few hours, then gathered between the thumb and first finger, adding the thick creamy mass of several plants together. This was used as a sort of chewing gum, called pia or ngau, which tasted very bitter at first. But after a little chewing, the bitterness disappeared, and this gum was much enjoyed, especially by the women, who vied with each other in seeing who could make her pia crack the loudest.'

>  <b>HICKEY</b> ... I issued a circular, stating that the Federation would stand behind the tramwaymen in any action that they might take. I had no authority whatever for issuing the circular, and in looking back on that time now, can only account for my impetuous action through my anger at the contempt displayed towards organised Labour by the City Council and the press. The leaflet (which happened to be printed on red paper, this giving the idea to the `Evening Post' [in early 1912] that was responsible for the coining of the term `Red Federation,' which was afterwards abbreviated to `Red Fed.') caused a wave of militancy to sweep through the tramway service, and a meeting was called for the p.m. shift the following day.

## ringanui
 
 <i>n.</i> a groundwater crustacean [ORIGIN: Maori, The name <i>Ringanui</i> is derived from the Maori words <i>ringa</i> (hand) and <i>nui</i> (big) in reference to the very large gnathopod 1 characteristic of this genus. **The name <i>toonuiiti</i> is derived from Maori <i>toonui</i> (thumb) and <i>iti</i> (little) and refers to the smaller robust seta defining the proximal end of the gnathopod 1 palm... **The name <i>koonuiroa</i> is derived from Maori <i>koonui</i> (thumb) and <i>roa</i> (long) and refers to the very large robust seta defining the proximal end of the gnathopod 1 palm...]

>  The new genus, Ringanui, is a significant step in resolving this confusion. Ringanui differs from Paraleptamphopus on several characters and is most easily recognised by diverse gnathopods, the first of which is enlarged relative to gnathopod 2. The two species are described and illustrated in detail. They differ in size and gnathopod characteristics, but other differences are small. Ringanui koonuiroa is the smaller species and is most easily recognised by the single, very long robust seta defining the palm of gnathopod 1. The second species, R. toonuiiti, is the larger, but its palmar defining spine is relatively short.

>  At the native meeting up the river the diversity of religions caused some discussion. There are four religions altogether, Protestant (Church of England), Catholic, Salvation Army, and Te Kooti's religion (Ringatu). The latter is a bugbear to some of the natives, particularly the Catholics, but the meeting decided on freetrade in this matter, the main argument being that as Englishmen had hundreds of religions there was no reason why the Maoris should not have at least four. ..

Those related to ways of shooting marbles were cribbing, firsts, fudging, funks, funnicks, funnigans, flunks, forces, knee-high, knuckle-down-stiff, knuckles, and lasts. Terms connected with the movement of the marbles were: cannons, clears, dead-stick, double-hits, fires, funs, gees, haystacks, in smug, keeps, kills, kisses, lay-ups, manyes, ones, pink, ringer, rolls, scat, screws, skinned, skun, spiders, sported-off, stays, stops, tracks, throughs. <i>Ibid.</i> 176 [Waitara, Taranaki, 1899: reference, game of Little Ring] Many heated arguments arose as to who said `everythings' or `nothings' first. If a player's `taw' touched a marble and lay alongside it, the others would shout `knuckle down' just before his turn. ... `Knuckle down' meant that the player had to hold his taw close to the marble attacked and fire it in that very inconvenient position. ... When a boy lost all his marbles at play he was `scat' [?related to skint ?HWO] . ... A `ringer' was a taw which, when fired at the commencement of the game, lodged in the track of the ring itself; that, and knocking a marble out when he `fired' were the perfect shots. ... To fire a shot while holding the hand nearer to the ring than where the taw had lain, was to `funk', an unforgiveable crime. (1972 -- ,Folkgames of Children,175)

In the early whaling days it was often served up to a whole village community from a canoe set up like a trough from which the villagers scooped their requirements in large bowls or paua shells. Many of the Ngati Raukawa of Otaki have vivid recollections of having eaten riripi in their childhood. (1966 -- ,Kapiti Coast,52)

The early settlers called it Maori Trout, Native Trout, Rock Trout and Minnow. But it is not a Trout. Nor is it a Minnow, through it resembles the English freshwater Minnow. While the name Trout is not correct, it is and will always be known as such by farmers and naturalists. In the Bay of Plenty, Whitebait is known to the Maori as Porohoe.

>  FOR SALE, a Small Farm, part of which is heavily timbered, convenient to a shipping place, with plenty of water, and a good run for cattle. (Apr 23, 1864 -- ,Otago Witness,12)

>  Run.- The pioneers of sheep farming in New Zealand and Australia came from various classes; but there were few among them who had been sheep farmers before and fewer still who were scientists. If they had been sheep farmers they would probably have used the English or Scotch sheep farming words (as they did to some extent) and fitted them to the new conditions. If they had been scientists they would have invented exact names for everything new, and translated them into Latin. What they did do was to take the handiest word they could think of and give it a new meaning, As time went on the word they had chosen changed or extended its meaning. The best example of all this is the word run. (Nov 18, 1933 -- ,Press, The,15) [NOTES: >Acland's senses 1 and 5 seem to be the central ones, with the others being specialisations of, or obvious inferences from those. -->cf also Morris]

>  [Cont] (1) The country held under a particular lease or pastoral license. [sic] (PAUL, p. 92) (2) Group of rs. held by one owner, or in one station. The whole area is spoken of as a r. (C.RH., p. 90) (3) Leasehold as opposed to freehold. (Sheep returns, 1878) (4) Open as opposed to fenced country. `Out on the r.'; i.e., not in any of the paddocks. ([1874 Lady Barker Station Life], p. 62) (5) Adjective. R. sheep, r. cattle, as opposed to paddock sheep or milking cows and hand-reared calves. (C.) (6) As equivalent to station: e.g. `He has sold his r.'; `One of the best rs. in Canterbury.' In this sense r. did not always include the sheep, as the word s[tation]. does. This usage is now uncommon and r. in these contexts would probably mean small grazing r. ([1874 Kennaway Crusts], p. 86;Butler A First Year in Canterbury Settlement],p. 152) (7) A block of country, a division of a r. E.g. ewe r. upper r. This sense was always rare, but is still in use on some ss. ([1898 Morris Austral-English]) (8) To keep or carry. `He runs merinos'; `the station runs 10,000 sheep' ([1898 Morris Austral-English]; C) (Nov 15, 1933 -- ,Press, The,15)

>  <b>MORRIS</b> Run, n. (1) Tract of land over which sheep or cattle may graze. It is curious that what in England is called a sheep-walk, in Australia is a sheep-run. In the Western United States it is a sheep -ranch. Originally the squatter, or sheep-farmer, did not own the land. It was unfenced, and he simply had the right of grazing or `running' his sheep or cattle on it. Subsequently, in many cases, he purchased the freehold, and the word is now applied to a large station- property, fenced or unfenced. (See quotation, 1883.) [1826] (1898 -- ,Austral English,397)

>  <b>TURNER</b> First a run is a parcel of land as leased. A sheepfarmer might own several adjacent runs of land, in this sense, and the whole `station' so formed might also be termed a run. In the third sense a run was leasehold as opposed to freehold land; in a fourth sense, open land as opposed to fenced land. It might be used as an adjective, e.g. run cattle. It might be the equivalent of station but without including the sheep, i.e. `He sold his run' need not imply that he sold his sheep, but `He sold his station' would. (1966 -- ,English Language in Aust. & NZ, The,50)

>  run: [1] This word has several uses but the most common refers to a stretch of work. The official shearing time of two hours is called a `run'. The day is divided into four of these. 7.30am-9.30am, smoke-o; 10.00am-12 noon, dinner; 1.00pm-3.00pm smoke-o; 3.30pm-5.30pm, tea. [2] Also another name for a sheep station. [3] Also the contract circuit. A shearing contractor will arrange a `run' of sheds for his gang each season. (1989 -- ,NZ English Newsletter,3/27) [NOTES: (Wallace Shearing Glossary)]
