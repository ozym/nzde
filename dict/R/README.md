Kawanatanga is subject to a promise to protect Rangatiratanga. Rangatiratanga is subject to an acknowledgment of Kawanatanga. The working out in practice of the balance between the two Articles must depend upon a case by case consideration. ...

In proof of this they assert that, when felling huge ratas, they often find a dead tree in the centre of the rata: this is a common occurrence, but it by no means follows that this species is a climber. The error is simply due to imperfect observation, which has led careless observers to confuse [<i>M. scandens</i> the Aka], which is a true climber with <i>M. robusta</i>. (Forest Flora,263)

The tree called by the Maoris Aka, which is another species of <i> Metrosideros (M. florida)</i> , is also often confused with the Rata by bushmen and settlers. In Maori, the adj. <i> rata </i> means red-hot, and there may be a reference to the scarlet appearance of the flower in full bloom. The timber of the Rata is often known as <i> Ironwood </i> , or <i> Ironbark </i> . The trees rise to sixty feet in height; they generally begin by trailing downwards from the seed deposited on the bark of some other tree near its top. When the trailing branches reach the ground they take root there and sprout erect. For full account of the habit of the trees, see quotation 1867 (Hochstetter), 1879 (Moseley), and 1889 (Kirk).

Actually there are two species' Sonchus oleraceus, whose lobed leaves are only mildly prickly and flat, or at the most very slightly waved at the edges, and S. asper, very similar except that the leaves are much more prickly, and are waved or crimped around the edges. The flowers are yellow, rather like those of a dandelion, about three-quarters of an inch in diameter. <i> Chewing Gum </i> According to some people, rauriki is the Maori name of the former and puwha of the latter, but I do not know that the Maoris went in for such nice distinctions. Different tribes had different names for the same thing. Puwha, as well as being one of the names for the sow thistle, seems to have been also used sometimes as a general term for any cooked greens, of which sow thistle was the favourite. (Otago Star) [NOTES: (I.W.T. Munro on `Maori Cabbage')]

>  <b>Jan 7, 1963</b> At Oxford, Makereti (Maggie Papakura) wrote: `I myself gather the sow thistle here and cook it to eat, as it reminds me of our own puwha, of which I am very fond. Puwha was used only as a vegetable ... The succulent stems contained a bitter milky juice which came to the surface when the flower tops were plucked off. This was left, on a sunny day, for a few hours, then gathered between the thumb and first finger, adding the thick creamy mass of several plants together. This was used as a sort of chewing gum, called pia or ngau, which tasted very bitter at first. But after a little chewing, the bitterness disappeared, and this gum was much enjoyed, especially by the women, who vied with each other in seeing who could make her pia crack the loudest.'

## recolonisation
 
 <i>n.</i>

>  <b>Nov 17, 2001</b> Belich divides the period covered by the volume, the 1880s to the present, into three broad phases: the progressive colonisation which was the dominant feature of <i>Making Peoples</i>; the rise of recolonisation, which tightened the relations between Britain and colonies up to the 1960s and made them co-owners of imperial culture and heritage; and finally decolonisation, the period since the 1960s in which New Zealand has achieved economic diversification, greater independence in foreign policy and a great socio-demographic "coming-out" of difference. (Listener (New Zealand Listener),57)

>  <b>Oct 28, 2001</b> But one pattern looms high above the rest, recolonisation, whose rise, reign and fall is the master variable of modern New Zealand history. (Sunday Star Times,C5)

>  <b>Jul 7, 2008</b> The red-band rule of thumb (a waterway that is deeper than a red-band gumboot or too wide to jump) allows for a farmer to opt out of planting these crucial small streams. On most farms, even a large river narrows to the point where it could be stepped across. Similarly there will be a wide point where even a larger river can be crossed wearing red-bands.

The leaflet (which happened to be printed on red paper, this giving the idea to the `Evening Post' [in early 1912] that was responsible for the coining of the term `Red Federation,' which was afterwards abbreviated to `Red Fed.') caused a wave of militancy to sweep through the tramway service, and a meeting was called for the p.m. shift the following day.

 <i>n.</i>

>  <b>Mar 19, 2003</b> Alison Nevill, of Dunedin, asks about the fascinating phrase "the whole rick-ma-tick". She says her Scottish grandmother employed a maid in the 40s who used it constantly, meaning something like "that's all there is to it". The maid came from Stirling, and the family always thought it was one of her home-town expressions, so when Alison got to New Zealand, she was surprised to hear it being used in the same context of finality. "The whole rick-ma-tick" has a long and honourable history as a Scottish version of "the whole kit and caboodle", an expression from the United States east coast that is widely understood here as an ornate alternative to "the whole lot".

## ringanui
 
 <i>n.</i> a groundwater crustacean [ORIGIN: Maori, The name <i>Ringanui</i> is derived from the Maori words <i>ringa</i> (hand) and <i>nui</i> (big) in reference to the very large gnathopod 1 characteristic of this genus. **The name <i>toonuiiti</i> is derived from Maori <i>toonui</i> (thumb) and <i>iti</i> (little) and refers to the smaller robust seta defining the proximal end of the gnathopod 1 palm... **The name <i>koonuiroa</i> is derived from Maori <i>koonui</i> (thumb) and <i>roa</i> (long) and refers to the very large robust seta defining the proximal end of the gnathopod 1 palm...]

>  <b>2006</b> The new genus, Ringanui, is a significant step in resolving this confusion. Ringanui differs from Paraleptamphopus on several characters and is most easily recognised by diverse gnathopods, the first of which is enlarged relative to gnathopod 2. The two species are described and illustrated in detail. They differ in size and gnathopod characteristics, but other differences are small. Ringanui koonuiroa is the smaller species and is most easily recognised by the single, very long robust seta defining the palm of gnathopod 1. The second species, R. toonuiiti, is the larger, but its palmar defining spine is relatively short.

>  <b>Nov 18, 1933</b> Run.- The pioneers of sheep farming in New Zealand and Australia came from various classes; but there were few among them who had been sheep farmers before and fewer still who were scientists. If they had been sheep farmers they would probably have used the English or Scotch sheep farming words (as they did to some extent) and fitted them to the new conditions. If they had been scientists they would have invented exact names for everything new, and translated them into Latin. What they did do was to take the handiest word they could think of and give it a new meaning, As time went on the word they had chosen changed or extended its meaning. The best example of all this is the word run. (Press, The,15) [NOTES: >Acland's senses 1 and 5 seem to be the central ones, with the others being specialisations of, or obvious inferences from those. -->cf also Morris]

>  <b>Nov 15, 1933</b> [Cont] (1) The country held under a particular lease or pastoral license. [sic] (PAUL, p. 92) (2) Group of rs. held by one owner, or in one station. The whole area is spoken of as a r. (C.RH., p. 90) (3) Leasehold as opposed to freehold. (Sheep returns, 1878) (4) Open as opposed to fenced country. `Out on the r.'; i.e., not in any of the paddocks. ([1874 Lady Barker Station Life], p. 62) (5) Adjective. R. sheep, r. cattle, as opposed to paddock sheep or milking cows and hand-reared calves. (C.) (6) As equivalent to station: e.g. `He has sold his r.'; `One of the best rs. in Canterbury.' In this sense r. did not always include the sheep, as the word s[tation]. does. This usage is now uncommon and r. in these contexts would probably mean small grazing r. ([1874 Kennaway Crusts], p. 86;Butler A First Year in Canterbury Settlement],p. 152) (7) A block of country, a division of a r. E.g. ewe r. upper r. This sense was always rare, but is still in use on some ss.

>  <b>1898</b> <i>MORRIS</i> Run, n. (1) Tract of land over which sheep or cattle may graze. It is curious that what in England is called a sheep-walk, in Australia is a sheep-run. In the Western United States it is a sheep -ranch. Originally the squatter, or sheep-farmer, did not own the land. It was unfenced, and he simply had the right of grazing or `running' his sheep or cattle on it. Subsequently, in many cases, he purchased the freehold, and the word is now applied to a large station- property, fenced or unfenced. (See quotation, 1883.) [1826] (Austral English,397)

>  <b>1966</b> <i>TURNER</i> First a run is a parcel of land as leased. A sheepfarmer might own several adjacent runs of land, in this sense, and the whole `station' so formed might also be termed a run. In the third sense a run was leasehold as opposed to freehold land; in a fourth sense, open land as opposed to fenced land. It might be used as an adjective, e.g. run cattle. It might be the equivalent of station but without including the sheep, i.e. `He sold his run' need not imply that he sold his sheep, but `He sold his station' would. (English Language in Aust. & NZ, The,50)

>  <b>1989</b> run: [1] This word has several uses but the most common refers to a stretch of work. The official shearing time of two hours is called a `run'. The day is divided into four of these. 7.30am-9.30am, smoke-o; 10.00am-12 noon, dinner; 1.00pm-3.00pm smoke-o; 3.30pm-5.30pm, tea. [2] Also another name for a sheep station.
