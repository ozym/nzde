unveiling,"Jan 26, 1984",Letter,K SMITHYMAN,,,"You know about the
Maori custom of
`unveiling' of
tombstones? If you
don't, it's more or
less like this: A
year after the
burial the grave
stone is installed,
and a monument being
unveiled. There used
to be two recognised
times for this in
the North,
apparently bypassing
the `year after'
which is seemingly
more the custom of
recent decades,
Easter and All
Saints Day, both of
which are distinct
from the usual fixed
times for clearing
the burial grounds
(which were usually
just before
Christmas or, in
some places, the
first Saturday in
March). In very
recent years around,
for instance, the
Hokianga, interest
and care for the
burial grounds has
markedly increased.
Along with that has
come another change,
in giving notice
publicly. I enclose
one long clipping
from the Whangarei
Northern Advocate of
a kind I doubt is at
all common, but the
NZ Herald supervisor
of memorial notices
tells me that to her
knowledge notices of
the kind have been
appearing for ten
years or so, but
(she thinks) are now
more frequent. So,
for a start, we have
a sense of unveiling
in NZ which is
likely to be
peculiar as `We went
up North for an
unveiling (of a
headstone for one or
more people)'. That
sense has been
around for some
time. What seems to
be new or newish is
the sense of the
other clipping, `So
and so was unveiled
on such and such a
day'. I checked with
Roger Oppenheim
whose book on Maori
Death Customs you
may know, and Roger
regards this as new
to him (and he has
Maori kin and
attends Maori
gatherings of the
kind). Where `Mr Te
Hona's unveiling was
on Saturday' doesn't
strike him (or me,
for that matter) as
anything out of the
way, `Mr Te Hona was
unveiled on
Saturday' registers
as odd, but didn't
seem odd to the

explanation of the
title, which, to

perhaps called for
... Most born New
Zealanders, whether
fair or dark, have
some conception of
the meaning of the
word UTU, albeit, to
pakeha ears it
toofrequently
conveys nothing more
than a hazy idea of
money compensation.
... Practically, utu
meant payment. The
ancient Maori did
nothing for nothing
... No man could
accept service or
gifts without
requital and retain
the esteem of his
fellows; still less
could he allow
injuries to pass
unavenged. Utu
(value) he expected
for the presents he
made; utu (payment)
he required for
goods or produce;
utu (satisfaction)
he exacted from
hereditary foes and
all whom he
conceived [?had]
injured him. A
vendor [?in] the
early days of
settlement, would
request UTU for his
produce; a settler
desiring to purchase
would enquire in his
pidgin Maori, `How
muchee te utu?' From
this milder meaning,
expressive of
compensation and
commodities
exchanged, comes the
pakeha use of the
word signifying
money. In settler's
parlance `Kahore ti
[?] utu' means `I
have no money', for
to their ears utu is
synonymous with
`tin', `sugar', and
other slang terms
used to denote our
medium of exchange.",
