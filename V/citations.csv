vegetable caterpillar,1847,Savage Life,ANGAS,1/291,,"Amongst the damp
moss at the root of
the rata trees, in
the shady forests
not far from
Auckland,and also in
various parts of the
Northern Island, are
found those
extraordinary
productions called
vegetable
caterpillars - the
hotete of the
natives. In
appearance, the
caterpillar differs
but little from that
of the common privet
sphinx-moth, after
it has descended to
the ground
previously to its
undergoing the
change into the
chrysalis state. But
the most remarkable
characteristic of
the vegetable
caterpillar is, that
every one has a very
curious plant,
belonging to the
fungi tribe, growing
from [292] the
.us;anus; this fungi
varies from three to
six inches in
length, and bears at
its extremity a
blossom-like
appendage, somewhat
resembling a
miniature bulrush,
and evidently
derives its
nourishment from the
body of the insect.
This caterpillar,
when recently found,
is of the substance
of cork; and it is
discovered by the
natives seeing the
tips of the fungi,
which grow upwards.
They account for
this phenomenon by
asserting that the
caterpillar, when
feeding upon the
rata-tree overhead,
swallows the seeds
of the fungus, which
take root in the
body of the insect,
and germinate as
soon as it retreats
to the damp mould
beneath, to undergo
its transformation
into the pupa state.
Specimens of these
vegetable
caterpillars have

they have been named
