Actually there are two species' Sonchus oleraceus, whose lobed leaves are only mildly prickly and flat, or at the most very slightly waved at the edges, and S. asper, very similar except that the leaves are much more prickly, and are waved or crimped around the edges. The flowers are yellow, rather like those of a dandelion, about three-quarters of an inch in diameter. <i> Chewing Gum </i> According to some people, rauriki is the Maori name of the former and puwha of the latter, but I do not know that the Maoris went in for such nice distinctions. Different tribes had different names for the same thing. Puwha, as well as being one of the names for the sow thistle, seems to have been also used sometimes as a general term for any cooked greens, of which sow thistle was the favourite.",(I.W.T.

Puwha was used only as a vegetable ... The succulent stems contained a bitter milky juice which came to the surface when the flower tops were plucked off. This was left, on a sunny day, for a few hours, then gathered between the thumb and first finger, adding the thick creamy mass of several plants together. This was used as a sort of chewing gum, called pia or ngau, which tasted very bitter at first. But after a little chewing, the bitterness disappeared, and this gum was much enjoyed, especially by the women, who vied with each other in seeing who could make her pia crack the loudest.'",

If they had been scientists they would have invented exact names for everything new, and translated them into Latin. What they did do was to take the handiest word they could think of and give it a new meaning, As time went on the word they had chosen changed or extended its meaning.

It was unfenced, and he simply had the right of grazing or `running' his sheep or cattle on it.
