Quote: The fish [snapper] caught on the long line are normally still alive when landed. Nowadays these are usually iki-spiked, a process of spiking the fish through the brain to kill it instantly. The iki-spiking splays the fins, accentuates the reddish colour and the individual blue spots, and, most important of all, delays the onset of rigor and so makes the flesh firmer. Unfortunately, most of this snapper goes to the lucrative Japanese market.

Notes: (In very early Colonial days the popular term was emigrant that is, from the point of view of leaving the mother-country.) Later (c1842) immigrant is chiefly used (from the point of view of established `old' colonist), and later replaces `emigrant' in Colonial literature completely, concretising its meaning to something like the modern `assisted immigrant'. For example, 1845 EJ Wakefield Adventure NZ, with ref. to ca1841-2 uses immigrant rather more often than emigrant (eg 2/437). For a fanciful, rhyming var., see Jimmygrant. cf also 189? Hutchinson's Australian Encyclopedia 158 The term immigrant is generally applied in Australasia to persons whose passages have been inwhole or part paid by the state. cf. also OED 1809 Kendall Travels Immigrant is perhaps the only new word, of which the circumstances of the U.S. has in any degree

Notes: 1951 16+ M 32 St Mary's, Wgton 30B CACTUS, IN THE CACTUS -(phs influenced by the phrs in the cack, in the poop, of similar meaning: cf cack-handed `awkward'). Cactus was the code name of Guadalcanal which was a very rough and remote place to be during most of the war; therefore `up in the Cactus' had a particular aptness'. (?Were the code names given by US or British authorities.) (Cf cactus stove, and compare North African equivalent Benghasi burner.) There was some contact between men in the Islands and men in North Africa (cf coconut bombers). If `in the cactus' was revived (or even recoined) in the sense `remote place, boohai, could it not become associated with the other sense (2), and a similar sense of <i>boohai</i> `up the shoot ; awry ; askew ; in the shit'.

The incoporation originated with the Native Land Court Act 1894, and according to Smith, <i>Maori Land Corporations </i> (1962) its original purpose was to facilitate the alienation of Maori land. Also <i>Maori incorporation</i>, a variant I could not find in DNZE.

Quote: Intercultivation.- In all districts subject to dry summers the question of putting at least a portion of the arable land under intercultivated crops should receive attention. By shallow surface cultivation a mulch is kept upon the surface, and soils thus treated part with their moisture far less rapidly than where intercultivation is neglected. One repeatedly sees abundant crops of kale, maize &c., so treated standing alongside crops of the same kind grown in the same paddock but not intercultivated, and which in consequence have withered and died.

Anyone - the runholder included - could buy the freehold of all or any part of a run at any time to establish a farm. However, some protection for runholders was essential, for they could not be expected to improve their runs if the land and improvements were in danger of being freeholdedwithout warning by an outside buyer. Runholders were able to register with the Provincial Council improvements such as buildings, plantations, fencing, and yards, for which they were granted [246] an improvement pre-emptive right (I.P.R.) covering fifty acres of land surrounding the improvement. A homestead pre-emptive right (H.P.R.), which afforded protection for 250 acres, could also be registered.

Quote: Irishman scrub; Also called Wild Irishman, or Matagouri. A hard prickly scrub, almost leafless, which grows on almost any land and stands any amount of drought or frost. The early settlers always called it by its English names: but since the [1914-1918] war it is as often asnot called by its Maori one. It is very good firewood, and station cooks used it largely for baking bread. Should its English names drop out of use they will be perpetuated in the names of many paddocks and flats; also in the name of Irishman['s] Creek Station.

Quote: Though by no means faultless, the measure [1846 Constitution Act] seems calculated to be a fair opening to the true history of our great Southern Colony, after the preliminary chapters of tragi-comic blundering. It sweeps away the whole system of official machinery and self-impeding sophistry established by Lord Stanley - all the `Treaty of Waitangi' nonsense, and all the past Downing-Street plans for hindering the settlement of the islands.' Henceforward, echoed the Colonial Gazette, `the humbug treaty of Waitangi' would be `very properly laid on the shelf'.

Quote: Iwi (now often translated as "tribes") were, at this time, idealised categories of related hapu that almost never acted as corporate groups... <i>Ibid.</i> 8 Iwi might have remained as ideal kin-categories, had it not been for British colonialism and Maori responses to it.

Quote: The smallest sociological unit is the biological family, which the Maoris termed whanau, derived from whanau, to give birth . ... The term hapu (pregnancy) was used to denote this expandedfamily group for it expressed the idea of birth from common ancestors ... The term iwi (bone) was brought into current use to include all the hapu descended from common ancestors and thusrelated to each other by a blood tie. To denote the groupings in English, the iwi has been termed tribe and the hapu a sub-tribe.

Quote: Commercial users of the Waikato River should prepare themselves for an "iwi tax" after Ngai Tahu imposed a conservation levy on eel fishermen at Lake Ellesmere in the South Island. Mr Smith described the levy as the forerunner to a new nationwide iwi tax system after his group of eel fishermen were asked to contribute $29,000, or 8 per cent of the total annual eel fishery earnings of $360,000, to Ngai Tahu for Lake Ellesmere environmental restoration purposes. The iwi also receives revenue for leasing out its quota.
