old identity,1874,Colonial Experiences,BATHGATE,25,,"[Old Identity] was the name applied by the people of Victoria, who flocked hither in thousands on the discovery of gold, to those who had been in the province before that time. Those honest folks, the tenour of whose ways had previously been very even, were greatly started by this immense and sudden influx of population. 16,000 persons landed in three months, and everythig went up to worse than famine prices. It is alleged that one minister actually prayed that the stream of rogues and vagabonds which was flowing into the country might be stayed, but this I believe to have been a base invention of the `new iniquity', as the new-comer were nicknamed. The term `old identities' took its origin from an expression in a speech made by one of the members of the Provincial Council, Mr. E.B. Cargill, who, in speaking of the new arrivals, said that the early settlers should endeavour to preserve their old identity. The strangers, who were inclined to laugh at the aboriginals as a set of old stagers, caught up the phrase, and dubbed them `old identities'. Acomic singer helped to perpetuate the name by writing a song the refrain of which was something in this style - `Touch not that shaky jetty, / Let that old post-office be, / That's one way to preserve / Your old identity'. So that anything effete came to be styled a regular `old identity'. So much did the name come to be a term of reproach among the Australian diggers that the barracouta 'thyrsites atum), a rather coarse fish, very abundant at certain seasons, and which was consequently very cheap, and a great favourite with boarding-house keepers, was christened by them `the old identity'",

old identity,1898,Contributions to the Early History of New Zealand,HOCKEN,201,,"The origin of the descriptive term `Old Identities' has been involved in some doubt. Not only is it a convenient one, but it is now widely used throughout the Colonies to [202] denote the oldest inhabitants, as distinguished from the newcomers, or `new iniquities.' Mr. Charles R. Thatcher, who was the son of a natural history collector at Brighton, and was about his father's business, came to Dunedin with the great rush in February, 1862, and gave vocal entertainments which were highly relished. He was a clever improviser, and nightly sang in rough verse to delighted audiences the events of the day, which then, though trivial, were numerous enough. Mr. E. B. Cargill was seeking a seat in the Council, and addressing the electors, regretted that the old settlers were being thrown into the shade, and that to prevent this they must make a strong and united effort. This was food for Thatcher, who thereupon brought down the house with a witty song of eight verses, each of which terminated with the refrain of `The Old Identity.' Thus:- `Does he wish each brother Scotchman/ To come out in a kilt - / To kittle up the chanter,/ And go in for a lilt?/ With bare legs in Otago/ How very cold 'twould be!/ But it's one way of preserving/ The Old Identity.' Yes, it did seem as though the `new iniquity' were, like a flowing tide, to obliterate the `old identity.' But no such catastrophe happened.",

out-station,1947,Wayleggo,NEWTON,,,(gloss) Some high country stations are so extensive that it is necessary to have a second homestead situated at some distant part of the property. Such a place is termed an `out-station'. On Molesworth station they even had a sub-manager at the out-station (Tarndale) in the early days.,
out-station,1947,Early Runholding in Otago,BEATTIE,11,,"The custom in the old days was to call the buildings on a run `the station,' and the land that went with it was `the run.' On a big property you could find several `stations,' and the principal one was called `the home station,' while the others were `out-stations.' This was the old Australianusage which was carried over to New Zealand at first, but gradually the signification was altered by loosely calling the whole run a station, and then the real station became a homestead and the out-stations became shepherds' huts. In this present book it will be noticed that generally thewriter has preserved the olden custom of calling the main buildings the station and the land the run. The runs over in Australia being, as a rule, much larger than those in New Zealand, the `station' and `out-station' phraseology was preserved much longer than over here, where even inadvertisements in the late 'fifties we see the English word `homestead' ousting the colonial word `station.'",

Oxford scholar,Oct 1977,NZ Numismatic Journal,,15,,"The crown was called a bull, a cartwheel, a caser, five bob, and most familiar of all a dollar, the latter dating from the time when the rate of exchange was four US dollars to the pound. The only instance recorded of Cockney rhyming slang term for a coin is Oxford scholar, the derivation from dollar being obvious. The half crown was called a half-dollar, a half-bull, half-caser, two-and-a-kick, and two-and-a-buck. In the latter instance buck stands for sixpence, though apparently this term was rarely used by itself for that coin denomination, but almost always in association with a number of shillings. The florin seems to have had fewer English nicknames, only two bob being recorded as being in use in New Zealand.",
oxidised country,1978,Gold Mining at Waihi (Glossary),McARA,328,,Oxidised country: This referred to country rock in which the iron minerals had been oxidised byexposure to the air above the permanent water-level giving it a brown instead of a bluish colour. The brown could be due to the oxidation of pyrite to limonite and haematite in the rock. Near the water-level there was sometimes a zone of semi-sulphides where the ore might be enriched by leaching downward of some of the values.,
