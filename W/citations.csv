in the 1860's, but
after 1864 the
official names,
`West Canterbury'
and `Nelson South
West', had some
popular currency.
Then a further
complication was
introduced. In 1859
John Rochfort had
had coined the name
`West land', a
shortened form of
`Westmoreland', the
name he used on a
map showing his West
Coast explorations.
After August 1865
the form `Westland'
was resurrected and
was used both for
electoral and
judicial districts
which covered part
or whole of the West
Coast. Popularly,
however, `Westland'
was used chiefly for
West Canterbury; the
remainder of
Canterbury Province
was sometimes called
`Eastland'. West
Canterbury became
the County of
Westland in 1868 and
the Province of
Westland five years
later. The Nelson
South-West Goldfield
kept this official
name until 1876 when
the provinces were
abolished.",
Westland,1967,West Coast Gold Rushes,MAY,15,,"`West Coast' remains
the popular term for
the strip of country
on the wrong side of
the Southern Alps,
though recently New
Zealand geographers
have adopted
`Westland' for the

Whatever its merits,
this term is
unsatisfactory. It
has some popular
currency south of
Greymouth, and it
may acquire
popularity through
its teaching in the
schools; but at an
indefinable point
north of Greymouth
one is likely to be
told, `This isn't
Westland, this is
the Buller'. A
region itself so
distinctive is also
marked by strong
local feeling. In
1960 `Westland'

disadvantage, that

require more capital
and strength, are to
be found mostly on

is thrown into the

most often occurs
for Maori people,
either as
individuals or as
members of a group,
when they are placed
in a situation where
they perceive
themselves to be at
a disadvantage and
thus to have a lower
status. Whakamaa,
therefore, has a lot
to do with mana,
which is most often
translated by Maori
people to mean power
or authority...
Third, utu or making

restoring a person's
