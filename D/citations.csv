deer track,Sep 1958,Tararua,,25,,"In recent years

hardto follow - a
way marked only by
blazes or worn by
animals, usually
deer. A track seems
to be something
broader, cut or
formed by man. ... A
well-known older
Club member made
this distinction
when, on hearing him
speak of a deer
trail, I asked him
what he thought to
be the difference
between track and
trail. I remarked
that I thought it a
very recent
distinction, one not
occurring in the
Club until about
1957. He disagreed,
believing it to be
one he had always
known. Yet, on
looking through The
Tramper, I could not
find deer trail used
until 1944, but deer
track occurs from
the first number in
1928 onwards, and he
himself had used it
in 1940. It remains
to be seen whether
this distinction
will become
established. In the
meantime deer track
still seems to be
used far more than
deer trail.",Ruth Mason `Track and Trail'

New Zealand is the

It is doubtful
whether the origin
of the term `Down
Under' will ever be
known. It first came
into general use
during the World War
of 1914-18, when the
New Zealanders who
fought in the
ill-starred
Gallipoli campaign
were referred to as
`the men from Down
Under', but that was
not the start of it.
This faraway land,
it seems, was known
as `Down Under' in
some parts of
England and Scotland
before the birth of
the present century.
The first World War
merely [put] the
expression into
wider usage. An
Auckland artist, Mr
Trevor Lloyd,made it
the subject of one
of his cartoons at
the very beginning
of that great
upheaval, and at
least one English
war correspondent
used the term when
writing on
Gallipoli. After the
year 1918 the
expression fell into
disuse, but during
the second World War
it again became
popular, and I think
we must thank the
Americans for its
revival. ... In
England it is also
known as the
Antipodes.",

would have to break,
