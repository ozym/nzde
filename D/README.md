Quote: She was always told that dag was Southland rhyming slang for wag, which latter seemed to her mostly used in the North Island at any rate. But the early use (now obs) of Dag! as an expletive (related to Doggon!), from 1917 and Dag at `a dab at' may have some bearing on reinforcement. The probable origin is in EDD n2., v2. 11. a daring feat among boys Ches w Mid w Som: e.g. Som `set a dag: perform some feat in such a way as to challenge imitation ... saying: `There's a dag for you ... do it if you can.'' 12. have or make a dag at `have a shot at'; OED2 sb&sup5. esp. doing dags, 1879. The earliest non-extant usage may have referred to an event, rather than a person, out of the ordinary, rather than vice-versa as the present evidence might suggest.

Quote: In the rural districts [of New Zealand] a formidable body of idiomatic uses is developing and a new language is being coined. This isno more true than it is of the `remote' back-country of Canterbury, where changing vocabulary is already a noticable geographical characteristic. The local idiom is naturally often linked with sheep, wool, and station practice. `Dag', for example, is a word used first to describe a tuft of wool fouled by excrement. The removal of dags from the hind-quarters of sheep is a seasonal operation usually called `crutching.' Used personally, `dag' was earlier a term of some approbation. Its meaning has widened, however, and now signifies no more than `hard case', or `tough guy', or `card.'

Domain: [none]

Notes: It is difficult to find "dairy" clearly used in the sense of a small mixed shop before 1943 ("cash grocer" seems to have been the usual term), the following sequence does seem to indicate the change in use from "dairy" as a supplier of milk (often with several depots around the town) to "dairy" meaning a mixed shop. The shop in Upland Road, Kelburn, was run in 1938 as a confectionary shop (cnfr); in 1939 it is listed in both Wise's and the Wellington telephone directory as "dairy" and is the only small shop listed under "Dairies" in the classified section which uses "dairy" in its trade name.

Quote: As well as superstitions, the whalers of Tory Channel had a few time-honoured habits. One of these was known as `a-day-for-the-Queen'. Its main application seems to have been when a whaler had had a heavy day on the grog and had butterflies in his stomach and head the nextday in the form of a hangover. If, for example, a harpoon-gunner like Trevor Norton was to have`a-day-for-the-Queen', he would be on a kind of half-alert. After a solid day on the booze he might find a nice, quiet bunk on board the Perano mother ship Tuatea, where he could nestle down rather than being on lookout duty up on the hill.

Something to do with dead ground I suppose.

Quote: The Oar-fish, 12 to 20 feet long, with a high, flame-tipped head-crest (the elongated fin rays) is probably the sea-serpent of repute. Its pelvic fins are narrow, elongated processes, hence the name Oar-fish. The Deal-fish is much smaller, but of the same type, but we know very little of the habits of either of them.

A trail seems to be something narrow and perhaps rather hardto follow - a way marked only by blazes or worn by animals, usually deer. A track seems to be something broader, cut or formed by man. ... A well-known older Club member made this distinction when, on hearing him speak of a deer trail, I asked him what he thought to be the difference between track and trail. I remarked that I thought it a very recent distinction, one not occurring in the Club until about 1957. He disagreed, believing it to be one he had always known. Yet, on looking through The Tramper, I could not find deer trail used until 1944, but deer track occurs from the first number in 1928 onwards, and he himself had used it in 1940. It remains to be seen whether this distinction will become established. In the meantime deer track still seems to be used far more than deer trail.

Quote: My guess the use may have come out of the Knowledge Wave Conference of 2001, precipitated by the parallel with the Irish Diaspora, which is thought to have contributed to the revival of the Irish economy. (The numbers however are very different400,000 NZers against 70m of Irish descent.) The Irish use may be recent too, perhaps as a result of Mary O'Regan(?) president of Ireland who made a major speech (about 1990 I think) in which she said that Ireland should reach out to its emigrants. Coming out of the KWC, there has been formed KEA (Kiwi Expatriates Association) to harness our diaspora for New Zealand's benefit.

Quote: The common method of addressing a New Zealander is to call him "digger," which, from being an abusive term, has been readily and universally adopted and approved by the Pig Islanders themselves. We, the N.Z.R.B., prefer to be addressed as "diggers" rather than "dinks" which was the original mode of address.

As with the Isle of Dogs in London, there is a belief that in the old days the docks of Port Chalmers caused it to be referred to as Dock Town, and the word became corrupted. But there are also legends that.. there were always many seamen about, sometimes unemployed, and all of them were accompanied by their dogs. Most of these men lived in cottages in George Street which became known locally as Dog Town and the name spread to mean Port Chalmers in general. It's occasionally heard even today.

Quote: The crown was called a bull, a cartwheel, a caser, five bob, and most familiar of all a dollar, the latter dating from the time when the rate of exchange was four US dollars to the pound. The only instance recorded of Cockney rhyming slang term for a coin is Oxford scholar, the derivation from dollar being obvious. The half crown was called a half-dollar, a half-bull, half-caser, two-and-a-kick, and two-and-a-buck. In the latter instance buck stands for sixpence, though apparently this term was rarely used by itself for that coin denomination, but almost always in association with a number of shillings. The florin seems to have had fewer English nicknames, only two bob being recorded as being in use in New Zealand.

Quote: Dover: [1898 Morris Austral-English] gives the meaning as a clasp knife. George McMillan, who came out in 1858, told me that when he arrived it was the custom for hands to find theirown knife, fork, spoon, plate, and pannikin, which were all called dovers. A man would offer work for `a pound a week and the run of my dovers'. The expression died out in Canterbury before 1860.

Quote: [A US writer] The little Dominion of New Zealand is the more or less happy land popularly known as `Down Under.' ... It is doubtful whether the origin of the term `Down Under' will ever be known. It first came into general use during the World War of 1914-18, when the New Zealanders who fought in the ill-starred Gallipoli campaign were referred to as `the men from Down Under', but that was not the start of it. This faraway land, it seems, was known as `Down Under' in some parts of England and Scotland before the birth of the present century. The first World War merely [put] the expression into wider usage. An Auckland artist, Mr Trevor Lloyd,made it the subject of one of his cartoons at the very beginning of that great upheaval, and at least one English war correspondent used the term when writing on Gallipoli. After the year 1918 the expression fell into disuse, but during the second World War it again became popular, and I think we must thank the Americans for its revival. ... In England it is also known as the Antipodes.

Notes: Jim writes: NSOD tags this as <i>chiefly NAmer</i>, Collins as <i>US, Canadian & NZ</i>. All OED citations are North American or refer to North America, except one from Australia in 1969. A <i>New Scientist</i> article in 1966 found it necessary to translate the word for English readers. However, I have recently heard and read it in British TV programmes and publications with reference e.g to Adelaide and Santiago. Is it used of British cities and since when? It has been common in NZ at least since the 70s esp but not solely in relation to Auckland and Wellington.

(Butler A First Year in Canterbury Settlement],p.135) About 1864 it was found possible to run sheep one at a time through a drafting race and move a single gate as they came, so drafting into two lots. See double gate. Cattle are usually now drafted in a stock-yard (q.v.). See also shed. (G.P. W.) (ii) A number of stock sent for sale, e.g. `The annual Stonyhurst draft of four-year-old ewes will be offered.' When the draft is actually offered it is usually spoken of as a line.

They are generally made of stout posts and rails; the corner posts ought to be much stronger than the rest, as they often have to bear the weight of a heavy bullock in branding and other operations. The yard is generally divided into three portions - viz., a large yard for the whole herd, a drafting yard, and a milking yard, at one end of which is placed the milking shed, cow bails, and calf house, the whole being so arranged that a calf can be let out to suck its mother on one side while she is being milked on the other.'

Quote: [The fibres of wood in a tree just about to fall] do not part all in one plane and `stringers' or `drawers' are drawn out of the barrel, sometimes several feet long. Sometimes men on contract, trying to save timber, place their saw-cut too low and some of the wood-fibres break off up in the barrel. These are `stringers' while they are breaking, and `slivers' or `drawers' when they are left upright in the sloven.

Quote: A `draw' was a serious defect, but was not due to any fault in the living tree. When a tree fell before it was quite severed, it sometimes, in the act of falling, wrenched or `drew' out a portion of the butt, leaving great jagged, fang-like splinters adhering to the stump. The damage was, of course, always to the heart wood ... [<i>Ibid.</i> 156 [Edward Thompson] ... very often, before the saw got within a foot or so of the front scarf, the tree would start to fall gradually, and the uncut timber between the saw and the front scarf would have to break, and seldom cleanly; the heart, being more brittle than the sap, would break here and there, several feet above where thesawcut would have been standing straight. As the tree fell, these pieces, still attached to the stump, would draw out of the tree, and being almost heart-wood constituted the chief defect we call `draws'.

Quote: A `drive' was in progress; as the men do the underscrubbing they note the large trees and their distance from each other. They scarf each one so that it will fall on the next. Then, after all the smaller timber has been brought down, they fell the first tree which falls on the second and so starts a whole sequence of crashes. The line need not be straight. More often, it zig-zags from right to left. Bushmen can do wonders by means of an ingenious drive.

Quote: The `drummer,' starting from the man who carried a drum, became the man who carried a swag and (then or thereafter) the loaded man (as a commercial traveller loaded with samples). To `carry the load' is another synonym; and the essential point throughout the symbolry was evidently the load. ... and a `drummer' is the man with the lowest tally - perhaps because he is likeliest to take and keep the track with his `load.'

He came to New Zealand in 1929 to be a lecturer at the newly-founded Massey Agricultural College. Shortly after his arrival Dr Dry discovered a ram lamb in a flock near Palmerston North which had an extremely hairy fleece due to an abundance of halo-hairs. Dr Dry's successful efforts to isolate the gene in Romney led to the development of the Drysdale. Dr Dry devoted nearly 40 years studying the genetic makeup of the fleece of the sheep and published many papers. He retired from Massey University in 1956 as Professor of Animal Genetics but continued his interest in the Drysdale till his death.
