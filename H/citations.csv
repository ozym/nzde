H.P.R.,1981,Station Years,CRAWFORD,,,"Although many runholders came to regard the land they leased as their own, their occupancy was intended to be only a temporary using of waste land until it was required for closer settlement. Anyone - the runholder included - could buy the freehold of all or any part of a run at any time to establish a farm. However, some protection for runholders was essential, for they could not be expected to improve their runs if the land and improvements were in danger of being freeholded without warning by an outside buyer. Runholders were able to register with the Provincial Council improvements such as buildings, plantations, fencing, and yards, for which they were granted [246] an improvement pre-emptive right (i.P.R.) covering fifty acres of land surrounding the improvement. A homestead pre-emptive right (H.P.R.), which afforded protection for 250 acres, could also be registered. ... One H.P.R. could be taken out for each property and it was only businesslike that each runholder should use this right to secure 250 acres around his homestead against purchase by an outsider. An H.P.R. was initially intended to cover the owner's or manager's home, but, in the case of runs of over 5,000 acres, could be extended to cover an outstation.",[ca1878]

heading,1966,"Encyclopaedia of New Zealand, An",McLiNTOCK,1/493,,"Heading. in the long head the competitor stands with his dog in a ring (1 chain in diameter) facing a hillside near the top of which three sheep are set loose. When time is called the dog is dispatched, either on a left-hand or a right-hand cast, up the hill for some 800 yards to a point behind the sheep. On command the dog `lifts' the sheep and, keeping them together, `pulls' them in a direct line back to his master in the ring. To allow the dog to show complete control over the sheep, the run ends with a `hold in the ring'. This involves stopping the sheep in the ring and holding them there. The first stages of the short head are much the same, but over half the distance, 400 yards. At the point where the sheep reach the shepherd, man and dog must drive them ahead down a `drive' which is 60 yards long and 1 chain wide and defined by short poles, to a set of hurdles which are 9 ft apart and parallel with the line of the drive. The sheep are driven between the hurdles and then down a second drive, similar to the first, to the pen or yard, which is 6 ft square. After opening one side, the competitor must stand by the pen gate until the sheep are yarded. The dog must do virtually all the work and his master's right of movement and intervention are strictly limited.",

home station,1947,Early Runholding in Otago,BEATTiE,11,,"The custom in the old days was to call the buildings on a run `the station,' and the land that went with it was `the run.' On a big property you could find several `stations,' and the principal one was called `the home station,' while the others were `out-stations.' This was the old Australian usage which was carried over to New Zealand at first, but gradually the signification was altered by loosely calling the whole run a station, and then the real station became a homestead and the out-stations became shepherds' huts. in this present book it will be noticed that generally the writer has preserved the olden custom of calling the main buildings the station and the land the run. The runs over in Australia being, as a rule, much larger than those in New Zealand, the `station' and `out-station' phraseology was preserved much longer than over here, where even in advertisements in the late 'fifties we see the English word `homestead' ousting the colonial word `station.'",
home station,1947,Early Runholding in Otago,BEATTiE,115,,"it is usually understood that in the early days the word `station' denoted the owner's house and its immediate buildings, while `run' meant the whole property. Strange to say, i only noted the word `station' twice, and each time with a diverse meaning. On July 21, 1865, the diary says: `Sold 17 head of cattle - remaining on station 15 head.' Then on September 11, 1865, we read: `Wilkinson returned to the Home Station.'

homestead,1947,Early Runholding in Otago,BEATTiE,11,,"The custom in the old days was to call the buildings on a run `the station,' and the land that went with it was `the run.'

This was the old Australian usage which was carried over to New Zealand at first, but gradually the signification was altered by loosely calling the whole run a station, and then the real station became a homestead and the out-stations became shepherds' huts. in this present book it will be noticed that generally the writer has preserved the olden custom of calling the main buildings the station and the land the run. The runs over in Australia being, as a rule, much larger than those in New Zealand, the `station' and `out-station' phraseology was preserved much longer than over here, where even in advertisements in the late 'fifties we see the English word `homestead' ousting the colonial word `station.'",

The word widely used was in all the above senses by Europeans who had dealings with Maoris, from the general `return for work, injury, etc.' to the concrete `money' it is often found constructed with the definite article `the utu, hutu' etc. translating the original Maori indefinite article, or adjective `some' he utu `an utu, some utu'. (Occas. constr with indef. article, see 1834). in later European usage the definite article was dropped to conform to English idiom eg' `give me the hoot' becomes `give me (some) hoot' The following is perhaps a `transitional' use 1828 C Davis journal Colenso Papers 3/18) `Another chief had been killed as a utu or payment'. (is this [ei utu] reflecting Maori [(h)e utu], as well as English a for an?). The phonology, resulting in the English hoot, parallels that of toot from tutu, with the final unvoiced [u] not being heard by English ears.

This was a situation where there was a deal in which a dealer intended to sell a truck for, say, $50,000 and required a deposit of $10,000 by any hire purchaser. in the case of a $50,000 truck (a hypothetical example) the dealer knew the hire purchase company was going to have reservations about financing the full $50,000. `So the dealer draws up a hire purchase agreement anyway. The real price is still $50,000. But on the agreement the dealer said he had received the sum of $10,000 by way of deposit.' Mr Smith said that if a hire purchase company accepted the assignment of the agreement the dealer got his money in full and the customer got his truck (then claimed to be worth $60,000) without having to pay a deposit.",1985?
