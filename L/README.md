## "lagoon"


WordClass: noun

Definition: This common word has wide contextual usage in NZ - essentially a smallish, shallowish body of water - not necessarily or usually salt: indeed it can have salt (see x) or fresh (see y), muddy, or mineral, or clear; frozen or cold ( ) or boiling. It can be deep enough to drown in, or shallow enough to be merely an overloaded swamp ( ), or `sheet of water', or can even have no water ( ). It can be of some square miles (see Lake Grassmere) or small as a pond; early NZ uses follow this standard sense: get geog. as well as temporal coverage.

Moving right along, leery became lairy, meaning flashy, eventually producing lair for a person who dresses in a vulgar, exhibitionist style. Properly, to lair up is to dress in this style.

A male lamb is a ram lamb until castrated, then a wether. A female lamb is a ewe lamb. After shearing, a ewe or ram lamb is usually called a shorn hogget until cutting the first two teeth. It is then called a two-tooth. Some use the term two-tooth as soon as the lamb is shorn. Next year the sheep is a four-tooth, then a six-tooth and then an eight-tooth or full-mouthed sheep. It is full-mouthed as long as the teeth remain perfect but then becomes broken-mouthed and gummy.

Quote: The all-engrossing topics [in Canterbury] seemed to be sheep, horses, dogs, cattle, English grasses, paddocks, bush and so forth. I was rather startled to hear one gentleman ask another whether he meant to wash this year, and receive the answer `No.' I soon discovered that a person's sheep are himself. He does not wash his sheep before shearing, but he washes; and, most marvellous of all, it is not his sheep which lamb, but he `lambs down' himself.

The long spikes of seed pods are often used for feeding caged birds. ... PLANTAIN (Plantago lanceolata) is commonly called rib grass, lamb's tongue, horse plantain, and soldiers. It is common in pastures and waste places throughout. It forms a rosette of lanceolate leaves about 6 inches long, with prominent or converging veins, giving the name `rib grass'. From the rosette rises the slender flower stalk a foot or more in length, with a crowded mass of tiny brown or black flowers at its tip. These heads are used by children for playing `soldiers,' and so in Scotland the weed is called `Carl Doddie'-that is `Charles and George'- a souvenir of 1745.

Quote: The fame of the West Coaster's `own' garment for outdoor workers - the ubiquitous miner's `lammie' - has spread far afield. This week a trial parcel of lammies was dispatched on request to members of the Malayan Police Force at Singapore who indicated in a letter to the Kumara firm which has made a specialty of supplying lammies since the gold rush days that they had heard of the unique qualities of the garment. The full story of the request from Singapore is not known, but it is believed that Auckland Chinese market gardeners may have been responsible. For many years Chinese gardeners have adopted the lammie as almost an `official uniform' and supplies for Auckland are regularly forwarded from the small business in Kumara. But what is a lammie? In the first place it is a strictly utilitarian garment with no claims to attractiveness in appearance. The original type - still in use after 70 years - was a loose-fitting almost shapeless shirt buttoned in front and with elbow-length sleeves made of flannel and water-proofed. It is this proofing quality which has established the popularity of the lammie. It was an ideal garment for outdoor workers in the West Coast climate, enabling them to keep drywithout the encumbrance of an overcoat and it was soon in general use on the gold fields, later to be adopted by bushworkers, navvies and many farmers. At first the lammie was made of moleskin, then grey flannel and over the past 20 years of navy flannel, but the proofing formula has remained unchanged. In recent years there has also been developed a modified style, double breasted Coast fashion, but the original shirt style is still popular. Apart from the fact that the historic gold-mining town of Kumara is regarded as the home of the lammie in New Zealand, the story of its origin has been lost. It is thought, however, that it was probably brought to the goldfields by the first Welsh diggers and that it may have been spelt `Llamy.' It was soon almosta universal garment among diggers, including big contingents of Chinese miners who found it ideal both for utility and for economy.

Mr. had a sluicing claim, and a draper named Todd used to get special flannel by the bolt for Mrs. Tait, and she made these `lammies.' She waterproofed them by dipping them in a special solution two or three times and hanging them on a line dripping wet, to dry each time. They were sold for 2 [pounds] 10/- to 2 [pounds] 15/- but I'm sure she never sold one to a Chinaman. There were hundreds there working tailings. It was Mrs. Tait's own invention I am sure. - I am, etc.,

Quote: `Clips', `keps', or landing chairs: A solid, dead flush, landing platform for the cages was required at each level and at the surface for getting full trucks in and out of cages. This platform was provided by a steel frame mounted on heavy bearers two or three feet below the level of the chamber floor so that it could be tilted into the shaft by a lever and make a strong support beneath the cages. It was balanced by a counterweight to make it easy to operate. To ensure that the two cages in the shaft worked exactly opposite each other when the chamberman `changed gear' to wind ore from a different level, he rang the change signal of five bells on the steel-wire knocker-line suspended in the shaft compartment, and the engine-driver placed the `free' cage on the surface `clips' (or `keps') and disengaged it on the engine drive-shaft. The chamberman then signalled to lift the `fast' cage on the level where he was working just clear of the clips, and pinned these back clear of the shaft. He entered the `fast' cage and rang the number of the level to which he wished to change, and was taken there by the driver. On arrival at the level he placed the clips in position in the shaft and rang the change signal, whereupon the driver placed the `fast' cage on the clips and put the `free' cage (which was sitting on the surface clips) in gear on the engine drive-shaft. Thus, when the cage was raised from the level to the surface, the cage from the surface would be exactly at the level from which the winding was taking place. Great care had always to be taken to ensure that the clips were not left protruding into the shaft as a serious accident could result if the cage crashed into them.

Quote: The chance mispronunciation of a colloquial word, by a Melbourne police officer, has added a new term to our language in the colonies. Who amongst us has not heard of the `larrikin'? He is essentially colonial, English cities may have `gamins` and the Pacific Slope can boast of `hoodlums` ... Though everybody speaks and writes about the `larrikin', what is he? ... I presume, I may say, he is of the male sex and that his age ranges from 12 to 21. He is oftown origin. His amusements are various. He likes to be in the streets, and rather prefers to be about theatres. Smoking is his pastime. As to his actions the larrikins may be classed under two headings: 1) The mischievous larrikin 2) the criminal larrikin.

Quote: LaraZ.ri-kin (l&abreve.raZ.r&ibreve.aZ.k&ibreve.n), n. [Cf. prov. Eng. larrick lively, careless, larack to frolic, to romp. See Note below] 1. A street blackguard; a rowdy. 2. A hobbledehoy inclined to rough horseplay and practical joking. 3. In a general sense, an ill-bred or low-minded person; - often used merely as a contemptuous epithet. 4. A neglected boy who frequents the streets; a street Arab; a gutter snipe. Marcus Clarke. In senses 1 and 2 this word has become common inEngland. Larrikin is thought to have come into use about 1870. Its origin, though much disputed, is commonly explained by the following anecdote : An Irish policeman at Melbourne, on bringing a notorious rough into court, was asked by the magistrate what the prisoner had been doing, and replied, "He was a-larriki' [i. e., a-larking] about the streets." This story lacks confirmation, but the word may not improbably be connected with lark to frolic, to which, indeed, the Prov. Eng. larrick and larrack are perhaps related.

Quote: The word has various shades of meaning between a playful youngster and a blackguardly rough. Little street-boys are often in a kindly way called little larrikins. (See quotations), 1870 and 1885.) Archibald Forbes described the larrikin as `a cross between the Street Arab and Hoodlum, with a dash of the Rough thrown in to improve the mixture.` (`Century.') The mostexalted position yet reached in liteature by this word is in Sir Richard Burton's Translation of the Arabian Nights' (1886-7), vol. i. p. 4, Story of the larrikin and the Cook; vol. iv. p. 281, Tale of First Larrikin. The previous translator, Jonathan Scott, had rendered the Arabic word, Sharper. -->There are three views as to the origin of the word, viz.-->(I) That it is a phonetic spelling of the broad Irish pronunciation, with a trilled rof the word larking). The story goes that a certain Sergeant Dalton, about the year 1869, charged a youthful prisoner at the Melbourne Police Court with being ` a-larrr-akin' about the streets.` The police Magistrate, Mr Sturt, did not quite catch the word- `A what, Sergeant?` -`A larrikin', your Worchup.` The police court reporter used the word the next day in the paper, and it stuck. (see quotation, `Argus,' 1896.) This story is believed by 99 persons out of 100: unfortunately it lacks confirmation; for the record of theincident cannot be discovered after long search in files by many people. Mr Skeat's warning must be remembered - -->`As a rule, derivations which require a story to be told turn out to be false.` -->(2) That the word is thieves' English, promoted like swag, plant, lift, etc., into ordinary Australian English. Warders testify that for a number of years before the word appeared in print, it was used among criminals in gaol as two separate words, viz. leary('cute, fly, knowing), and kinchen(youngster), `learykinchenshortened commonly into `leary-kin' and leary kid'. Australian wardens and constables are Irish, almost to a man. Their pronunciation of `leary kin' would be very nearly `lairy kin,' which becomes the single word larrikin. (See quotation, 1871.) It is possible that Sergeant Dalton used this expression and was misunderstood by the reporter. (3) The word has been derived from the French larron (a thief), which is from the Latin latronem (a robber). This became in English larry, to which the English diminutive, kinwas added; although this etymology is always derided in Melbourne.

Why it should share with one of our petrels and the great <i> Dacelo </i> of Australia the trivial name of laughing jackass, we know not; if its cry resembles laughter at all, it is the uncontrollable outburst, the convulsive shout of insanity; we have never been able to trace the faintest approach to mirthful sound in the unearthly yells of this once mysterious night-bird.'

When I was a small boy, these shrieks gave me the creeps. I thought they sounded as if all the demons had got loose and were trying to frighten us, and I was always very thankful that there was someone nearby to protect me. I have not heard any of these birds for over thirty years, and presume that the stoats and weasels have accounted for them.

## "laundry"


WordClass: noun

Definition: a room in a house used principally for washing and (since the advent of clothes dryers) drying clothes and linen.
Origin: [none]


Domain: [none]

Region: [none]


Notes: Jim writes : In relation to places this is much the most common use of the word in NZ. Not in DNZE or - in this sense - NZPOD but recognised in NZ Oxford Paperback. NSOD defines <i>laundry</i> as an establishment where clothes etc are laundered, Collins as a place where clothes and linen are washed and ironed, which encompasses the NZ use but is unspecified. In most modern houses in England clothes are washed in the kitchen and there is no separate room. In NZ until recently bylaws prohibited washing clothes in a room used for preparing food. <i>Laundry</i> is known in England in the NZ sense but seems uncommon. In a 1987 Property supplement to a Midlands newspaper it rarely appeared in the detailed house descriptions and always as an attributive - <i>laundry area, laundry room</i>. The term <i>laundry room</i> appears in Ruth Rendell, <i>Harm Done</i> 2000. The Australian situation (and word) was similar to the NZ one according to Hudson <i>Modern Australian usage</i>. MAU p223. Macquarie 1981 is consistent with this. Salmond <i>Old NZ Houses</i>p. 200 suggests that the change of name from wash-house to laundry was associated with the advent of the bungalow style i.e. c1910-1920. Cf <i>porch</i>. But see <i>wash-house</i>. The same book implies (anachronistically?) a possible much earlier use "Until the 1880s... water was heated... in the laundry copper for washing clothes and for the children's weekly bath." p. 143. Two house plans (<i>Ibid.</i> p. 198-99) are of interest. One dated 1930 has a "washhouse" under the same roof as the house; the other dated 1924 has a basement "laundry".

Lots of quick short words to fit in the breathless pauses as you pant uphill. `Crud' (cloud), `bush-bash', a `gunn' tramper (which must have originated from Davy Gunn's famous trek up the Hollyford Valley to help victims of a plane crash in 1936; he travelled 40 km by rowing boat, horse and foot in 21 hours), `windfall' (a collapsed pile of trees), `pit' (the tramper's true friend, a sleeping bag), `pog' (porridge), `bastard grass' and `lawyer' (two unpleasant plants), `piker' (one who stayed home), `Huey' (all-powerful god of weather), and many, many more.

The yard was divided into three - one large and two small - but as there was no crush pen, or drafting race, we had to head rope those requiringbranding, and after hauling them up to a corner post, leg-roped and threw them on [44] their side, placing a long lever on their neck and under the lowest rail so that they would not move much ... When released the poor beast is not in an amiable temper ... So anyone in the yard has to climb the rails quickly ..., and the idea that it may catch you before your legs are safely over the cap rail certainly accelerates one's movements.

There were Little Ring, Liney, Follows, Follow the Taw, Holey, and then, on a less important scale, Butcher's Board, in which the marbles were bowled through the holes in a board, Eye-Drop,Knock-Backs, Leggings-Out (or Leggin's-Out), Span-'Em, and Backits.

## "loaf"


WordClass: noun

Definition: In esp. NI towns, the standard `loaf' size was usually the two-pound, with a half-loaf being a pound. In country districts, esp. in the South Island, the standard loaf size was usually four-pound; with a half-loaf, two-pound, and a quarter-loaf, one pound. `Tourists' and holiday makers from towns were and are often thus confused when ordering country bread: the town's `half' was the country's `quarter' loaf.

Quote: <i>bread</i>: It comes in standard-sized loaves (government regulation). 350g (about 12 oz), 500g (about 1 lb), 700g (about 1 and a half lb). Unfortunately, common parlance for these loaves differs between the North and South islands. Many of the 700g loaves are made like a camel with two so that they can conveniently be split in half. Usually, if you ask for a loaf in the South Island it is one of these two humps (350g) that you get. In the North Island, if you want the same amount of bread (350g) you must ask for a half loaf. The other thing about bread, is that in this land of abundant food, where restaurant servings are usually generous, it is very hard to get more than one piece of bread (or one roll). Unlike North America, where they seem to hope you will settle for smaller servings if you fill up with bread, in New Zealand restaurants appear afraid that you will spoil your appetite with the stuff.

## "lolly shop"


WordClass: noun
SenseNumber: 2
Definition: (figurative) a brothel
Origin: [none]


Domain: [none]

Region: [none]


Notes: (further from Dalley's article 10) The lolly shops and tobacconists behind which some one-woman brothels operated were more than a convenient facade or 'legitimate' reason for men to gather. Many of the one-woman brothel keepers ran their front shops, as well as their prostitution trade, as regular business enterprises, selling merchandise as any other retailer would. The association between the legitimate frontage and the activity in the back rooms also reflected what Ann-Louise Shapiro has termed the 'polymorphous world of commerce and sexuality' which infused urban life in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

On February 10, 1916, Truth published an article entitled 'A Grave Problem, Vile Disease and Dreadful Truth' about the so called 'lolly shops' in Cambridge Tce that were actually facades for brothels... Dalley has investigated the existence of these lolly shops, which were legitimate after a law was passed in 1908 that allowed prostitutes to operate from brothels providing they didn't employ anyone else... During World War I troops from Trentham came into town and lined up outside the shop... Particularly because it was opposite the Queen Victoria statue - it became known as Gallipoli.

NSOD & Collins define the word in this sense as "esp. of 2 armchairs and a settee." NZPOD following English POD gives "a sofa and armchairs of the same design." This is usually called a <i>lounge suite</i> in NZ, a term not recorded in the British dictionaries. The NZ use of suite ordinarily encompasses also a <i>dining suite</i> and a <i>bedroom suite</i>. (I have seen bedroom suite used in an English mystery novel published a few years ago). See furniture store ads in any newspaper or circular. In NZ, the meaning of <i>suite</i> by itself would be uncertain except in context.
