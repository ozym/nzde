lammie,"May 12, 1952",Evening Post,,9,,"The fame of the West
Coaster's `own'
garment for outdoor
workers - the
ubiquitous miner's
`lammie' - has
spread far afield.
This week a trial
parcel of lammies
was dispatched on
request to members
of the Malayan
Police Force at
Singapore who
indicated in a
letter to the Kumara
firm which has made
a specialty of
supplying lammies
since the gold rush
days that they had
heard of the unique
qualities of the
garment. The full
story of the request
from Singapore is
not known, but it is
believed that
Auckland Chinese
market gardeners may
have been
responsible. For
many years Chinese
gardeners have
adopted the lammie
as almost an
`official uniform'
and supplies for
Auckland are
regularly forwarded
from the small
business in Kumara.
But what is a
lammie? In the first
place it is a
strictly utilitarian
garment with no
claims to
attractiveness in
appearance. The
original type -
still in use after
70 years - was a
loose-fitting almost
shapeless shirt
buttoned in front
and with
elbow-length sleeves
made of flannel and
water-proofed. It is
this proofing
quality which has
established the
popularity of the
lammie. It was an
ideal garment for
outdoor workers in
the West Coast
climate, enabling
them to keep
drywithout the
encumbrance of an
overcoat and it was
soon in general use
on the gold fields,
later to be adopted
by bushworkers,
navvies and many
farmers. At first
the lammie was made
of moleskin, then
grey flannel and
over the past 20
years of navy
flannel, but the
proofing formula has
remained unchanged.
In recent years
there has also been
developed a modified
style, double
breasted Coast
fashion, but the
original shirt style
is still popular.
Apart from the fact
that the historic
gold-mining town of
Kumara is regarded
as the home of the
lammie in New
Zealand, the story
of its origin has
been lost. It is
thought, however,
that it was probably
brought to the
goldfields by the
first Welsh diggers
and that it may have
been spelt `Llamy.'
It was soon almosta
universal garment
among diggers,
including big
contingents of
Chinese miners who
found it ideal both
for utility and for
economy.",
lammie,May 1952,Evening Post,,13,,"[corresp. col.] Sir,
- In reference to
your article on the
West Coast shirt
called a `lammie,'
when a girl over 58
years ago I used to
visit a couple named
Tait who lived in
Dillsmanstown. Mr.
had a sluicing
claim, and a draper
named Todd used to
get special flannel
by the bolt for Mrs.
Tait, and she made
these `lammies.' She
waterproofed them by
dipping them in a
special solution two
or three times and
hanging them on a
line dripping wet,
to dry each time.
They were sold for 2
[pounds] 10/- to 2
[pounds] 15/- but
I'm sure she never
sold one to a
Chinaman. There were
hundreds there
working tailings. It
was Mrs. Tait's own
invention I am sure.

landing chairs: A
solid, dead flush,
landing platform for
the cages was
required at each
level and at the
surface for getting
full trucks in and
out of cages. This
platform was
provided by a steel
frame mounted on
heavy bearers two or
three feet below the
level of the chamber
floor so that it
could be tilted into
the shaft by a lever
and make a strong
support beneath the
cages. It was
balanced by a
counterweight to
make it easy to
operate. To ensure
that the two cages
in the shaft worked
exactly opposite
each other when the
chamberman `changed
gear' to wind ore
from a different
level, he rang the
change signal of
five bells on the
steel-wire
knocker-line
suspended in the
shaft compartment,
and the
engine-driver placed
the `free' cage on
the surface `clips'
(or `keps') and
disengaged it on the
engine drive-shaft.
The chamberman then
signalled to lift
the `fast' cage on
the level where he
was working just
clear of the clips,
and pinned these
back clear of the
shaft. He entered
the `fast' cage and
rang the number of
the level to which
he wished to change,
and was taken there
by the driver. On
arrival at the level
he placed the clips
in position in the
shaft and rang the
change signal,
whereupon the driver
placed the `fast'
cage on the clips
and put the `free'
cage (which was
sitting on the
surface clips) in
gear on the engine
drive-shaft. Thus,
when the cage was
raised from the
level to the
surface, the cage
from the surface
would be exactly at
the level from which
the winding was
taking place. Great
care had always to
be taken to ensure
that the clips were
not left protruding
into the shaft as a
serious accident
could result if the
cage crashed into
them.",

(See quotations),

Archibald Forbes
described the
larrikin as `a cross
between the Street
Arab and Hoodlum,
with a dash of the
Rough thrown in to
improve the
mixture.`
(`Century.') The
mostexalted position
yet reached in
liteature by this
word is in Sir
Richard Burton's
Translation of the
Arabian Nights'
(1886-7), vol. i. p.
4, Story of the
larrikin and the
Cook; vol. iv. p.
281, Tale of First
Larrikin. The
previous translator,
Jonathan Scott, had
rendered the Arabic
word, Sharper.
-->There are three
views as to the
origin of the word,
viz.-->(I) That it
is a phonetic
spelling of the
broad Irish
pronunciation, with
a trilled rof the
word larking). The
story goes that a
certain Sergeant
Dalton, about the
year 1869, charged a
youthful prisoner at
the Melbourne Police
Court with being `
a-larrr-akin' about
the streets.` The
police Magistrate,
Mr Sturt, did not
quite catch the
word- `A what,
Sergeant?` -`A
larrikin', your
Worchup.` The police
court reporter used
the word the next
day in the paper,
and it stuck. (see
quotation, `Argus,'
1896.) This story is
believed by 99
persons out of 100:
unfortunately it
lacks confirmation;
for the record of
theincident cannot
be discovered after
long search in files
by many people. Mr
Skeat's warning must
be remembered -
-->`As a rule,
derivations which
require a story to
be told turn out to
be false.` -->(2)
That the word is
thieves' English,
promoted like swag,
plant, lift, etc.,
into ordinary
Australian English.
Warders testify that
for a number of
years before the
word appeared in
print, it was used
among criminals in
gaol as two separate
words, viz.
leary('cute, fly,
knowing), and
kinchen(youngster),
`learykinchenshortened
commonly into
`leary-kin' and
leary kid'.
Australian wardens
and constables are
Irish, almost to a
man. Their
pronunciation of
`leary kin' would be
very nearly `lairy
kin,' which becomes
the single word
larrikin. (See
quotation, 1871.) It
is possible that
Sergeant Dalton used
this expression and
was misunderstood by
the reporter. (3)
The word has been
derived from the
French larron (a
thief), which is
from the Latin
latronem (a robber).
This became in
English larry, to
which the English
diminutive, kinwas
added; although this
etymology is always
derided in
Melbourne.",
