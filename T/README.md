Wellington), Butcher Bats (Ohau, Takaka), Penny Doctor Beetles (Tauranga, Pipiriki, Rotorua), or Fishing (Morunui).

This may be called the silver table; ... The flow then passes over blanket tables, which arrest mechanically all the heavier particles. <i>Ibid.</i> 179 The blanket tailings or blanketings, as they are otherwise called, consist mostly of iron pyrites and other sulphides, cobines with quartz, and contain a fair proportion of gold ...that had escaped over the silver tables. These tailings are treated in berdans with extra quicksilver and ground up. The berdans now in use at the Thames ... are generally five feet in diameter ... At one time a couple of rotating balls were considered sufficient for the amount of crushing required; now, the general practice is to have a loose ball as well as a stationary one attached to a chain, and it is called a drag ball; this drag does more work than a loose ball ... for the drag grinds the bowl as much as the tailings.

## "tai timu"


WordClass: noun

Definition: with TAI PARI perhaps indicative of the change in time and place of Pakeha vernacular knowledge of Maori Williams 361 <i>Tai (i) ... Sea.: timu `ebb(ing)'</i> (he tai timu<i> `low water'); pari</i> `flowing (of the tide)'. Both were intelligible to many English speakers up to at least the 1930s, and possibly the 1950s in the North Island, as witness the following joke first heard by me as a child in Havelock (South Island) possibly from an original King Country version; and first mentioned as early as 1845 by Walter Brodie in <i>The State of New Zealand </i>where it is attributed to Mr [?initial] Williams. Tim and Paddy were walking along the beach when they came across two Maoris arguing, as it semed to them, ferociously. One was crying out `Tie Tim!' and the other, `Tie Paddy!'. Paddy took to his heels shouting: `You can bloody well tie Tim if you like, but I'm damned if you'll tie Paddy!' Enjoyment of the joke depends not only on knowing the meaning of the Maori forms, but also on a non-Maori perception of Maori /r/ as [d], and failure to hear a devocalised /u/ final. In 1986 it is usually necessary to `prepare' the joke with tedious explanation.

Quote: "Taihoa" does not mean careful consideration, prudent and wise advancement, careful deliberation, putting on the brake, chewing things over, although it may be used for these reasons. English-ised, this word corresponds to our own adverb 'by-and-by'- postponing indefinitely for any reason or for no reason at all what may be said or done at once. It has always meant this and can never mean anything else, whether applied to the occasional or habitual procrastinations of a pakeha,Maori chief, or honourable Parliamentarian grievously pestered by urgent petitions of insatiate constitutents.

Quote: a New Zealand word for devil, often applied by settlers to a vicious horse or as a name for a dog. There is a dangerous river, the Taipo, on the west coast. There is considerable dispute as to whether the word is true Maori or not. The Rev. T. G. Hammond of Patea says - -->`No such Maori word as taipo, meaning devil, exists. It would mean evening-tide - tai-po. Probably the early sailors introduced attached meaning of devil from the Maori saying, `Are you not afraid to travel at night?' referring to the danger of tidal rivers.' -->On the hand, Mr. Tregear says, in his `Maori Comparative Dictionary,' s.v. - -->`Taepo, a goblin, a spectre. C.f. <i>tae</i>, to arrive; <i>po</i>, night.' The Rev. W. Colenso says, in his pamphlet on `Nomenclature' (1883), p. 5 - -->`Taepo means to visit or come by night, - a night visitant, - a spectral thing seen in dreams, - a fancied and feared thing, or hobgoblin, of the night or darkness; and this the settlers have construed to mean the Devil! - and of course their own orthodox one.'

Quote: <i>taipo,</i> supernatural being; goblin: used by the Maori believing it to be Pakeha, and by the Pakeha believing it to be Maori; often spelt taepo, which also is not a Maori word: so taipo is a word coined by no one knows whom... <i>taipo</i>, see the remarks following the word in list 2. There is a Maori remark that may be quoted here: Haere ra! E tama E! Mou te tai ata, moku te tai po (Farewell! O son! lit. Yours the morning tide, mine the evening tide, meaning You pass with the morning tide, as I will pass by the evening tide). The saying was often used in war, when a man saw a young relative or friend slain; and the words were often prophetic of his own fate. The meaning is quite destroyed if the last two words are run together - taipo instead of tai po: that results in the word under discussion, making the meaning: You pass on the morning tide, while I go to the devil! - naturally a modern interpretation. A Pakeha using the expression once confused that last words and made them taepa; when it meant: You pass on the morning tide, while I get over the fence. So near is the approach of the ridiculous to the sublime.

Quote: The inhabitants of this Island [sc. southern South Island] in common with some savages are very superstitious, their faith in the power of their priests is slavish, and all sickness is ascribed to supernatural or perhaps infernal agency. Taipo being the supposed author of the disease whatever it may be. Taipo is a foreign word, its native place and etymology I cannot trace, but as it appears to mean the Devil and is of universal use I shall not disturb it.

Quote: Next to the X class. is the Z class, or what are often referred to as the Cornwall Cup boats. They owe their existence to a small band of Takapuna yachtsmen who planned the first boat, with much the same idea in their minds as did George Honour when he built the first of the 14-foot square bilge boats, namely, low first cost, ease of construction, and an ever-watchful eye on speed and performance under Auckland harbour weather conditions. The yachts were originally designed for the Takapuna Boating Club but owing to their popularity from the outset the type was quickly adopted by many other yacht clubs throughout New Zealand... From small beginnings the Takapuna one-design class rapidly expanded.

During the torching season the birds run down the paths to the sea at night. Paths are used as boundaries by the [56] supervisors and in some cases the dividing line is the middle of the path.

Quote: Climatic conditions, the treatment sheep have had in the months before shearing, and the breeds of the sheep all play a big part in a shearer's tally. For this reason a shearer's tally can fluctuate considerably, depending on the type of sheep he is shearing. It is a mistake for young shearers to make `tally' paramount in their ambition to progress in shearing when quality of work would have to be the first point taken into account. <i>Ibid.</i> 157 TALLY.

Quote: Tamariki, Tamarikitanga - children were traditionally openly cared for, and shared particularly by both parents and grandparents; they had the advantage of being able to expect similar care and protection from not just close kin, but other parents within the hapu (larger kinship group). They were encouraged to become independent and responsible as quickly as possible. One detrimental effect of urbanisation on the economic realities of today is the breakdown evident in such caring.

Quote: The tamarillo, it seems, is still a fruit New Zealand has largely to itself, for though it is grown in private gardens around the world in warm frost-free places like California, South Africa, Asia and Africa, only here is it cultivated systematically on a commercial scale... In the 1880s, Mr D Morris, director of the Botanbical Gardens in Jamaica, sent seeds to the hill districts of India and Sri Lanka, and it was from northern India that the first seeds were sent to New Zealand, to Hay and Sons, nurserymen of Parnell in Auckland. The Hay's 1891-1892 catalogue states that the nursery then had "plants of strong and healthy appearance" for sale... The name "tamarillo" officially came into being on January 31, 1967, after New Zealand exporters decided a more romantic, exotic name was needed than "tree tomato". The strategy worked, and today tamarillo seems to have become the accepted name internationally.

Quote: Although it sounds Spanish, the name 'tamarillo' is another New Zealand invention. The former name 'tree tomato', was considered inappropriate for use overseas where people buying the fruits for the first time might expect them to taste like tomatoes. In 1967, orchardist Bill Thomson took the Maori word 'tama' added 'tillo' (taken from tomatillo, a complete unrelated Mexican fruit) and then (just to make the sound more mellifluous) he replaced 't' with an 'r'. Thus, 'tamarillo' was born.

Quote: Supplies of tropical fruits were curtailed because of the Japanese threats to the sea lanes, and tamarillo (or tree tomato as they were then known) growing began in earnest. [WWII] <i>Ibid.</i> 141 An uncultivated native of the Andes region of Peru, the tamarillo is also found wild in India, Sri Lanka and parts of South East Asia. It was from the hilly regions of northern India that New Zealand's first seeds came, introduced by the Auckland nursery of D. Hay and Sons in 1891. At first only the yellow and purple varieties were grown and it was not until the end of World War I that the now almost universal red variety was bred at Mangere, Auckland.

Quote: Two well-known New Zealand exports, neither of them native, are tree-tomatoes and Chinese gooseberries, but neither is called that by the exporters. The tomatoes are a South American fruit, a rich source of vitamin C and long popular in New Zealand. About twenty years ago, the name <i>tamarillo</i> was deliberately contrived, much as a brand name is. On the basis of <i>tomato</i>, a diminutive<i> -ill-</i> was added; then <i>tomatillo</i> was altered, in honor of a legendary Maori tribal hero, Tama-te-kapua, to <i>tamatillo</i>; and then a change to <i>tamarillo</i> was considered more euphonious. And so a new word was born.

Quote: The perfect symbol for all this is the Meremere taniwha. This one-eyed spirit stopped work on a new highway.. and gave National leader Bill English a new slogan. A reference to the Treaty in new legislation became the "taniwha clause" - a phrase coated in political poison... Historian Michael King says the issue "has nothing to do with the literal existence of non-existence of taniwha. Taniwha are a metaphorical way of saying that place is either dangerous or has special spiritual or historical significance. The way Maori signified that was by talking about taniwha or guardian to make poeople respect it and to explain the fact that sometimes people disppeared or drown or whatever, in those places".

Every girl promised in marriage is tapued, and married women also, until chastised by their husbands, when the `tapu' ceases, and they are then free to any one who can catch them, a remarkably good plan for securing the affections of the husband, and relieving the sex from some of those periodical chastisements in which some of the husbands in this country are so apt to indulge.

Quote: In the old days <i>tar</i> was always used to put on sheep cut by the shears. Nowadays some carbolic dip, kerosene, or Condy's is used; but it is always called <i>tar</i>. When he cuts a sheep the shearer calls out `Tar, boy, tar on the leg,' and a fleecepicker or broomie dabs the disinfectant on with a <i>tar-stick</i> and puts it back in the<i> tar-pot</i>. .

Quote: WHITE FRONTED TERN (<i>Sterna striata</i>), Tara of the Maoris, is abundant all around the New Zealand coasts and occurs in Tasmania and Eastern Australia as well. This is the graceful little `Kahawai-bird' or `Sea-swallow,' which pursues schools of small surface fish, wheeling, darting and dipping to the water, in its energetic quest of food. Since the Kahawai fish is predaceous on the small school fish also, the tern is an excellent indicator of the presence of Kahawai.

One team, the `outs,' went and hid, while the home team, looked for the `outs.' As soon as an `in' player saw an `out,' he cried, `All in for Tommy Jones' (the `out' player who had been spotted). At that cry all the `in' players raced for home, and all the `out' players emerged from their hiding places and attempted to tag them. If all the `in' players could get home without being tagged, then the person seen (Tommy Jones), was considered captured, and he had to come and sit in the home base, And so the `in' team went on trying to sight players and [53] then get home without being tagged.

Quote: In the 1860's the first Dalmatian gum diggers arrived fleeing hard times back in their Adriatic homeland. As the diggers were exclusively men, they found wives among the Maori community who called the newcomers Tarara, a reference to the sound of their speech.

Quote: A prostitute is not called a tart by Cockneys, because `tart' has always meant a girl. It is a street word, not used indoors, but it is not coarse or unpleasant. It conveys a well made up, attractive girl. One might say `Who's that ginger-haired tart,' or `Harry was talking to a tart', or even `your tart' - though the last shows a poor vocabulary and would be said only by children. The term has been going strong for at least seventy [83] years, and probably derives from something like `jam tart'; given that, why should a reference to colourfulness and sweetness be offensive?

Quote: The Golden Kiwi established partly to prevent sent money being sent out of New Zealand for tickets in Tatt's, a Tasmanian lottery with a name abbreviated from Tattersall's and quite unconnected with the English cant word <i>tatts</i> `dice'. It was illegal to sell tickets in Tatts' in New Zealand but many barbers' shops displayed a notice, `We communicate with Hobart', which was universally understood. . . .It was clear that in the context of a barber's shop window the notice meant `we sell tickets in Tatt's', but legally a man can announce that he writes to Tasmania. Newspapers might report the good fortune of winners but the illegal source of the winnings would not be specified. The money came from `an overseas consultation'.

Quote: `Pakeha' is a word that seems to be bugging many New Zealanders. Perhaps this is the reason why the Royal Commission on Social Policy in its booklet dealing with the Treaty of Waitangi uses the word `Tauiwi' instead of `Pakeha'. For example a section of the booklet is headed `Partnership between Maori and Tauiwi'. Tauiwi, according to the booklet's glossary, means `later settlers from another country'. A Dictionary of the Maori Language ... gives `strange tribe, foreign race' as the meaning of Tauiwi. As a New Zealander born and bred in this country I was disturbed at the unceremonious use of a word which seems to make me some sort of foreigner in my own land. ... On phoning the commission's office I was informed that despite considerable unease over the use of Tauiwi in the treaty booklet staff were told that it had to be used. I was also informed that the use of Tauiwi instead of Pakeha had been discontinued.

There are also two Taurahere (urban groupings) since 80% of the tribe live outside the traditional Ngapuhi boundaries (40% in Auckland alone). The TRAION structure is grassroots focussed with the marae and all who whakapapa to these marae being the main drivers for the vision, and for the tribal immortality of Ngapuhi.

Kirk was quoted on the singular exception in the case of the beeches, which the Maori seemed to class together as tawhai adding, perhaps, in our own manner, a descriptive modifying word or words, as tawhairaunui for the large-leaved beech. The recent studies of Dr. L. Cockayne (NZ State Forest Service, Bulletin No4, 1926), show that in this, too, the Maori was right ; the rigid specific distinction did not exist: As in Hebe (Veronica) there is much hybridization. ... and as the Veronicas were all Koromiko to the Maori, so the varieties of Nothofagus were all tawhai.

Quote: The Whakarewa Grant was part of what was called the `tenth', a term coined by the New Zealand Company for land it reserved for Maori people. The principle of the tenths was conveyed in the instructions from the New Zealand Company in 1839 to its principal agent, Colonel William Wakefield, before he set out for New Zealand. In `every purchase of land from the natives ... a proportion of the territory ceded will be reserved by the Company and held in trust by them for the future benefit of the chief families of the tribe ... `You will explain that after English immigration and settlement a tenth of the land will be far more valuable than the whole was before'. ... To Alexander MacKay, commissioner of Native Lands, writing in 1872, the tenths `guarded the natives that common failing of all Aboriginal races, want of foresight, and it secured them from the dangers to which colonisation exposed them'. In short, land was a better asset for the Maoris than cash. In Nelson, the `tenth' comprised a total of 15,000 acres of land, involving a mix of urban and rural land in Nelson, Motueka, and Golden Bay. Most of that land remains in Maori ownership and today is managed by an incorporation. The Whakarewa land - the most valuable area of the tenth - has however been subverted from the control of the ...

In exchange for giving up the scenic and uneconomic parts of their land for a massive conservation estate, pastoral lease holders get freehold title to the rest of their property. [18] Currently, the main way of achieving it [sc. taking land for the conservation estate]is known as tenure review; a huge land swap inside the pastoral leases that make up 20 percent of the South Island and 10 percent of New Zealand.

Quote: The organisation had been outlined by Field Marshal Lord Kitchener on a visit to New Zealand in 1910. All New Zealanders from the ages of 14 to 30 years were liable for part-time military training. Boys from 14 to 18 years served in the senior cadets, and young men from 18 to 25 years served as Territorial soldiers with the regionally affiliated regiments and battalions - hence the name `Territorial'. Service in the reserve was a requirement from the age of 25 to 30, but legislation allowed for this service to be extended up to the age of 55 years in the case of a national emergency. The same legislation allowed the Territorial Force to be mobilised by proclamation for service in New Zealand, and Section 26 (1) of the 1909 Defence Act made provision for members of the Territorial Force to volunteer for special service outside New Zealand.

Quote: Australian aborigine words which were new to this side. In 1851 a number of Australian `squatters' came over and took up runholding in Canterbury, but, generally speaking, their advent was some years later in Otago. ... They brought over a number of Australian aborigine words that were new to this side, and which were used a certain amount, usually in a joking manner as far as I know. I have heard some of them fairly frequently used by the `old hands,' sometimes oracularly and sometimes as a semi-humorous quotation. When I was a boy I heard sheep called `jumbucks,' an Australian aborigine term for them, but with the decease of ex-Australian stockmen the word has gone out of use now. Another term brought over from Australia was `maimai,' for a rough shelter from the weather. It was said to be a name for a blackfellow's camp, which I have always seen spelt `miamia,' and which is called `gunyah' or `wurley,' etc., by some tribes. We now apply the name to shooting shelters.

Quote: DELUGED [heading] I am beginning to think that I must be the only ignoramus in Dunedin who has never heard of a thunderplump. Everyone else has known the word since childhood and, as a Buccleugh Street reader neatly put it, I was fairly deluged with thunderplumps yesterday. Other readers wanted to explain that `plumps' were to be found in many dictionaries, but I was aware of that anyway. Most of the people who knew of thunderplump claimed a Scottish origin for it, but it still took me quite a time to locate it in my range of dictionaries. Finally I ran it to earth in a seven-volume Century, published back in 1891, which gave it as `A short violent downpour of rain in connection with a thunder-storm (Rare),' and produced a 19th century quotation. Perhaps we didn't hear it much in Invercargill in my younger days because thunderplumps are pretty uncommon there; but a colleague who came from Winton certainly knew of it; and it was even noised abroad by the Canterbury English. ...

Quote: Among the trees Mr. Traill pointed out [on Stewart Island], was what he called a `Ti Mi' tree, and which he said was only found growing in one place in New Zealand, that being Mokai, on the west coast of the North Island. He stated that the Maori tradition about it was this - that the first Maoris who visited New Zealand came in a large canoe built of `Ti Mi' wood, and they landed at Mokaia, where there is a good harbour. canoe got broken up, and some of the planks took root and grew.' Paulin WWC, pp. 33-4. [Andersen notes:] The canoe referred to was the `Tainui', and the tree is said to be the karaka or kopi. White Ancient History Maori (1890), vol. 4, p. 38.

Quote: The appearance of Ti palms on the Canterbury plains is very remarkable. They rise amidst the short rich grass with their thick stalks and graceful crest; often when one looks up suddenly from the ground, startling with their likeness to men. One of our wags remarked of these plants, that they looked `like men as trees walking'. A less observant youth having lost his way a few nights ago, in the neighbourhood of the capital, was cheered in the loneliness of the prairie, by the appearance of a man approaching. He took off his hat, (not having yet forgotten the courteous address of the old country,) and accosted the stranger, `I beg your pardon, sir, but can you tell me which is the way to Christchurch.' It was a Ti palm.

Then a long length of cotton was attached to the smaller piece and led away to the gate. The cotton was pulled every now and then and the button tapped against the window. It was nighttime, and folks would pull up the blind and peer out. Some more adventurous spirits would come out and investigate and would maybe get entangled with the cotton. Then the culprit would run away to some other house. (1900; Moeraki)

Quote: A warning like the English schoolboys' `cave!'. From J. M. Barrie's <i>Peter Pan</i> where Hook was always warned of the approach of the crocodile because of the ticks of the alarm clock it had swallowed. If a master approaches, the boys warn the rest with `tick tick!'. Also used in the expression `to go tick' - that is, to go on watch for masters and prefects while the rest get into mischief.

Even within marae. one cannot know all the `tikianga' of that tribe, since aspects of life may only be known by specialists. To find out the tikianga of each marae, one should ask connected tangata whenua or knowledgeable people of the right way to enter and speak and act on that marae. To break `nga tikanga' is to invite (polite) scorn and this means a lowering of `mana'. Tikanga - see `kawa'.

Quote: The bushmen that did this work were a tough capable lot - a race apart - whom no difficulty could deter, and who performed amazing feats with a few quite primitive tools. These were axes, maul, and wedges, crosscut saws, mattocks for earth work, pinching bars or crowbars, and the versatile New Zealand-made timber jack. These jacks weighed about 80 pounds and by geared cogs multiplied the man power applied to the revolving handles so that the `spear' with its two chisel points, when applied to a log, could exert a lifting pressure of 5 tons.

The `tin' mill only needed seven or eight men to operate it, and its output was no more than half that of the `big' mill. But within a short time these small mills became so popular that many farmers bought their own and could thresh their grain exactly when it suited them and their crops.

Quote: <i>raddled:</i> This word means `robbed' in the sense of being deprived of one's proper payment. It is an extension of `raddling', carried out by unscrupulous farmers before the Shearers' Union looked after shearers' interests. Any sheep considered unsatisfactorily shorn was marked with red or blue raddle and such a sheep would not be counted in the shearer's tally. The raddle stick was also called a `Toby'. This must not be confused with [27] marking a sheep for other purposes, such as identification of certain sheep for easy selection later.

Quote: What is the origin of the "toby". the tap that turns off water at the street frontage of a house?... I am prepared to wager that it is derived from "toby", which was the gypsy-tinker slang term for "street. There is an early link between tinkers and plumbers, both being experts with the soldering-iron, and I think the plumbers took over "toby" from the tinkers. Consequently, when they turned water off "at the toby" they were turning it off at the street.

The word has been explained as of convict origin, that the rags were used to soothe the galling of fetters; but the explanation is not satisfactory, for the part galled by the irons would not be the toe, but the ankle. A writer in `Truth' has cleared up the word (see quotation). It is of Maori origin. Away from Maoriland "toe-rigger' had no meaning, and a false meaning and origin were given by the change of vowel.

Quote: <i>toetoe</i>, giant ornamental grass (Arundo conspicua), the flower-culms used for reed-work between the carved slabs of house-walls, cross-laced in a variety of patterns with narrow strips of flax [147] or pingao, white and black or bright orange (the tukutuku-work): very often mis-spelt toitoi or toi toi, or tohi tohi. Though the name toetoe is by the Pakeha confined to Arundo, by the Maori it is applied to various species of rush and grass with a qualifying suffix: Arundo is toetoe-kakaho, the latter word referring to the valued culms. Some people object to the reed tukutuku-work as being flimsy and perishable: in reality it is as durable as galvanized-iron and far more handome and artistic: the interior of a good Maori house is a thing of beauty.

A rook would apply to some bookmakers, but where does the `Tommy' come in? The bookmakers were never named Tommies after soldiers, who are so dubbed, for when the latter lie on the field they've generally been shot at, whereas the bookie when he lays on the field, he's not been shot at, and, moreover, he never lays himself open to be shot at, either by marksmen or punters. Tommy is certainly a misnomer, and it should have been applied to a backer, who is ever the target for the unerring aim of the Bar Von.

Quote: The now obsolete term <i>tonguer</i> was also in use in the early 1830's, and very likely before it although I have discovered no written records of it prior to 1836. A tonguer was a native or white living in New Zealand who assisted a whaling crew to cut up whales and who also acted in the capacity of an interpreter. These men earned their name not from the act of interpreting, but from the fact that they were given the whale's carcase and tongue to dispose of as they wished.

Quote: [<i>Notho]fagus fusca</i>,Hook. f. ... Tooth-leaved Beech. Black Birch of Auckland and in part of Otago and Southland. Black or Bull Birch of Lake Wakatipu. Red Birch of Wellington, Nelson, and in part of Otago and Southland. It is not so easy to see why any difficulty should have occurred in the identification of this fine timber-tree apart from the misleading tendency of the common names generally applied. The thin yet firm texture of the leaf, the prominent veins, the sharply-toothed margins, are characters that can only be confused with those afforded by a careless observer. Yet merely owing to the use of common names based upon colour, and applied or rather misapplied to the leaves, bark, or wood at the fancy of the bushman, no species has been more misunderstood. <i>Ibid.</i> 302 All the men engaged at the sawmills [of West Oxford] had heard of `tooth-leaved beech,' but only one or two of them had seen it growing, and no one had seen it converted.

Quote: The utmost confusion prevails among the common names of the birches. There are scarcely two districts, a few miles apart, in which the same name is applied to the same tree, and a similar result may be obtained by consulting two bushmen in the same bush. With a view to obviating this difficulty Mr Kirk suggests `the adoption of new names based of the obvious characteristics of foliage [e.g.] for Fagus fusca `tooth-leaved beech'; for Fagus solandri `entire-leaved beech' etc. [This is unsuitable as foliage varies] I would suggest the retention of the common Otago names Fagus fusca - Red birch ; F. solandri - Black-heart birch ; F Menziesii - Silver birch.

Quote: Ever since the beginning, to `take' meant journeying to the islands and living there for the season and using hands or any device to catch the birds. ... to `take' also includes an `attempt to take'. During the torching season the birds run down the paths to the sea at night. Paths are used as boundaries by the [56] supervisors and in some cases the dividing line is the middle of the path. If one pursues a bird and grabs it over the other edge of the path one can be prosecuted, even although the bird came from the pursuer's manu. <i>Ibid.</i> 68 The `torching' season became known as such because the birders used flaming torches thick enough to be held aloft comfortably grasped in the hand. They were about three feet long and well soaked in muttonbird fat, before being set alight and were made from dry tree branches. Piles of these `torches' were prepared and set aside awaiting [69] the start of the `torching' and each family had their torch bearers. In most cases this duty was carried out by the children. Gradually this primitive method of `lighting the way' gave place to the European kerosene lantern and when supplies of kerosene were exhausted a lighted candle was sometimes used inside the glass globe of the lantern.

Quote: Townships are formed here and there as settlement proceeds; - at first a store and post office, a cottage or a blacksmith's shop perhaps; then a hotel, another store, and again another hotel. <i>Ibid.</i> 20 Sanguine in their anticipations, and bountifully provident for the wants of posterity, the promoters of these bush townships - whether it were the Government, private companies or individuals, or a supplementing of the former by the latter - made the boundaries of them wide enough for all possible future requirements, and gave ample scope for prospective development. This was very commendable and necessary in some instances, but where a township, as sometimes happened, did not `go off' at the sale, or if it did go off, was never subsequently embellished with a building of any kind, the effect had something of the ludicrous about it - for while settlement went on around the `township,' and the land was cleared and occupied, the `town' itself remained a solid block of standing bush, and the absentee owners of its acre or quarter-acre sections were only reminded of their possessions by the persistent recurrence of the notices to pay rates

Quote: In the bush or in the open do you tramp on a <i>track</i>, a <i>trail</i>, or a <i>path</i>? Not on a path one may be sure, seldom if ever on a trail, almost always on a track, like a proper New Zealander... <i>Track</i> is undoubtedly the established word in New Zealand. It is the only one occurring on maps or applied to named routes, such as <i>Hongi's track</i>, the <i>Milford track</i>, the <i>Pahiatua Bush Track Road</i>. ..[25] It is interesting to compare the use of <i>track</i> and<i> trail</i> in <i>The Tramper</i>. Through the first volumes <i>track</i> is always used when referring to an actual track, and <i>trail</i> occurs rarely and then only in the expression <i>blazed trail</i> or more or less figuratively - `to fare forth on the trail'. In 1935 there is the first definite use of <i>trail</i> as a synonym for <i>track</i> in a reference to the `Handbook of Arthur's Pass National Park'. It is significant that it occurs in reference to Arthur's Pass for trail seems to have come into use in Canterbury in this sense before it reached Wellington. It occurs once or twice in the first volume of the <i>Canterbury Mountaineer</i>, and there is the <i>B.B. Trail </i>in the Arthur's Pass Hand book of 1935. From 1939 till 1940 in <i>The Tramper, trail </i>is used moderately frequently for an actual track, e.g. `an old Maori trail', `a miner's trail', but only by the one writer, a Wellington member of the Canterbury Mountaineering Club. <i>Trail</i> shows no sign of ousting <i>track. </i>

Quote: In recent years there seems to have been a tendency to use both <i>track</i> and<i> trail</i> and to differentiate between them. A trail seems to be something narrow and perhaps rather hard to follow - a way marked only by blazes or worn by animals, usually deer. A track seems to be something broader, cut or formed by man. ... A well-known older Club member made this distinction when, on hearing him speak of a deer trail, I asked him what he thought to be the difference between <i>track</i> and <i>trail</i>. I remarked that I thought it a very recent distinction, one not occurring in the Club until about 1957. He disagreed, believing it to be one he had always known. Yet, on looking through <i>The Tramper, </i> I could not find <i>deer trail</i> used until 1944, but <i>deer track</i> occurs from the first number in 1928 onwards, and he himself had used it in 1940. It remains to be seen whether this distinction will become established. In the meantime<i> deer track </i>still seems to be used far more than <i>deer trail.</i>

Quote: In the bush or in the open do you tramp on a <i>track, trail</i>, or a <i>path</i>? Not on a path one may be sure, seldom if ever on a trail, almost always on a track, like a proper New Zealander. ... I well remember the shock of astonishment when in 1937 I first saw <i>trail </i>used in New Zealand. The word was on a rough signpost pointing out the beginning of White's Track at Piha. I am afraid I thought somewhat scornfully, `Hm, some townie who has never been out of the city or set foot off a pavement has got all his ideas of New Zealand outdoor life from reading books about North America.'...[25] It is interesting to compare the use of <i>track</i> and <i>trail</i> in <i>The Tramper</i>. Through the first volumes <i>track</i> is always used when referring to an actual track, and <i>trail </i>occurs rarely and then only in the expression <i>blazed trail</i> or more or less figuratively - `to fare forth on the trail'. In 1935 there is the first definite use of<i> trail</i> as a synonym for <i>track</i> in a reference to the `Handbook of Arthur's Pass National Park'. It is significant that it occurs in reference to Arhtur's Pass for trail seems to have come into use in Canterbury in this sense before it reached Wellington. It occurs once or twice in the first volume of the <i>Canterbury Mountaineer</i>, and there is the <i>B.B. Trail</i> in the Arthur's Pass Hand book of 1935. From 1939 till 1940 in <i>The Tramper, trail</i> is used moderately frequently for an actual track, e.g. `an old Maori trail', `a miner's trail', but only by the one writer, a Wellington member of the Canterbury Mountaineering Club. <i>Trail</i> shows no sign of ousting <i>track. </i>

Quote: In recent years there seems to have been a tendency to use both <i>track</i> and <i>trail</i> and to differentiate between them. A trail seems to be something narrow and perhaps rather hard to follow - a way marked only by blazes or worn by animals, usually deer. A track seems to be something broader, cut or formed by man. ... A well-known older Club member made this distinction when, on hearing him speak of a deer trail, I asked him what he thought to be the difference between<i> track </i>and <i>trail.</i> I remarked that I thought it a very recent distinction, one not occurring in the Club until about 1957. He disagreed, believing it to be one he had always known. Yet, on looking through <i>The Tramper</i>, I could not find <i>deer trail</i> used until 1944, but <i>deer track</i> occurs from the first number in 1928 onwards, and he himself had used it in 1940. It remains to be seen whether this distinction will become established. In the meantime <i>deer track</i> still seems to be used far more than <i>deer trail.</i>

Though the Club in 1919 was the first in New Zealand and probably the first in the world to take the name of <i>tramping club</i>, and by its usage and activities has played a considerable part in establishing the term, the meaning we give to <i>tramp</i> was not of New Zealand origin, for it was used colloquially in England as early as 1908 for `to go on foot, to go on a walking expedition'. The nature of the country into which the expeditions are made may often be very different from that [29] where the term originated, but the essential idea is the same. ...

It is said that the hobnailed boots of the players contribute strongly to the hazards of the game.

Quote: `Pakeha' is a word that seems to be bugging many New Zealanders. Perhaps this is the reason why the Royal Commission on Social Policy in its booklet dealing with the Treaty of Waitangi uses the word `Tauiwi' instead of `Pakeha'. For example a section of the booklet is headed `Partnership between Maori and Tauiwi'. Tauiwi, according to the booklet's glossary, means `later settlers from another country'. A Dictionary of the Maori Language ... gives `strange tribe, foreign race' as the meaning of Tauiwi. As a New Zealander born and bred in this country I was disturbed at the unceremonious use of a word which seems to make me some sort of foreigner in my own land. ... On phoning the commission's office I was informed that despite considerable unease over the use of Tauiwi in the treaty booklet staff were told that it had to be used. I was also informed that the use of Tauiwi instead of Pakeha had been discontinued

Quote: Though by no means faultless, the measure [1846 Constitution Act] seems calculated to be a fair opening to the true history of our great Southern Colony, after the preliminary chapters of tragi-comic blundering. It sweeps away the whole system of official machinery and self-impeding sophistry established by Lord Stanley - all the `Treaty of Waitangi' nonsense, and all the past Downing-Street plans for hindering the settlement of the islands.' Henceforward, echoed the Colonial Gazette, `the humbug treaty of Waitangi' would be `very properly laid on the shelf'.

Quote: Although it sounds Spanish, the name 'tamarillo' is another New Zealand invention. The former name 'tree tomato', was considered inappropriate for use overseas where people buying the fruits for the first time might expect them to taste like tomatoes. In 1967, orchardist Bill Thomson took the Maori word 'tama' added 'tillo' (taken from tomatillo, a complete unrelated Mexican fruit) and then (just to make the sound more mellifluous) he replaced 't' with an 'r'. Thus, 'tamarillo' was born.

Quote: TREVALLY (ARAARA) <i>Usacaranx lutescens</i> (Richardson) For some unknown reason small Warehou sold on the Dunedin Fish Market and in the shops of Dunedin were called Trevally and the same fish with the same markings when grown to eighteen or twenty-four inches in length were known as Warehou. Just how and when these small Warehou received the name Trevally no one seems to know. .../ [T]he old time Maori was recognised as a student of Nature and much more observant than the Pakeha, who blindly follows other and called fish by all sorts of names without ever stopping to think - as for instance when they call Seaperch the John Dory. Each fish is totally different. The misuse of common names of fish in New Zealand is most glaring but the mistake of calling the young Warehou by the name of Trevally is not made in the North Island, as both species are caught there; only odd Trevally are caught south of Cook Strait.

Quote: As the quartz mines began to decline in output and could no longer pay a large wage sheet, it became the custom to let them on tribute, by which parties of men were given the right to mine and raise quartz from the resultant crushing, of which a proportionate share of the gold went to the company. This system might also apply to old workings of mines in actual work, but in most of these cases the tributors followed a thin but valuable lead, which might not be much thicker than a finger, but so rich as to be worth tunnelling or working as a tribute, in which the golden lead was pursued on an upward slope. It used to be rather shrewdly suspected that tributors were not `working on the blind' but had as former employees of the company marked a lead and covered the same by a piece of mine timber or rubble till a later date give them the chance to profit by their knowledge. Many of the tributors did exceedingly well; they had nothing except their labour to lose, and the company got some profit on a good lead, and so `where's the harm?'

Quote: As the quartz mines began to decline in output and could no longer pay a large wage sheet, it became the custom to let them on tribute, by which parties of men were given the right to mine and raise quartz from the resultant crushing, of which a proportionate share of the gold went to the company. This system might also apply to old workings of mines in actual work, but in most of these cases the tributors followed a thin but valuable lead, which might not be much thicker than a finger, but so rich as to be worth tunnelling or working as a tribute, in which the golden lead was pursued on an upward slope. It used to be rather shrewdly suspected that tributors were not `working on the blind' but had as former employees of the company marked a lead and covered the same by a piece of mine timber or rubble till a later date give them the chance to profit by their knowledge. Many of the tributors did exceedingly well; they had nothing except their labour to lose, and the company got some profit on a good lead, and so `where's the harm?'

Quote: <i>you're a trimmer!</i> a compliment or a curse; from English word `trimmer', a person who literally thrashes, meaning performs vigorously. Shepard example: `The key is stuck in the keyhole. You think you've jiggered it. Along comes your fix-it cobber and all's well. Gee, you say. You're a trimmer.' Shepard example two: `What did you move that for? I had them in the right order. Gawd, you're a trimmer.'

Quote: The sheep they shore were not so well woolled on the belly and carried less wool on the points than they do now, so that fewer short blows were required to take off the trimmings; but the shears they used were one inch and a half shorter in the blade and, being joined by a single instead of a double bow, required a wrist of iron to drive them continuously throughout a summer's day. A piece of raw hide known as a knocker is now used to prevent the shears clashing when closed, but before this was introduced the clack and snap of steel meeting steel was a noise inseparable from any busy shearing shed.

The carcases, being relatively warmer than the air, always lost moisture to it; this formed snow which blocked the trunks, cutting down the air circulation and giving the `snow-men', who had to crawl through the trunks, a bad time in clearing them.

Quote: <i>tui</i>, a bird (Prosthemadera novaeseelandiae), the most characteristic of the smaller Maori birds, kept by the Maori as a pet and by them taught to speak, it being an excellent mimic, and so by the settlers called the mocking-bird, shortened to mockie, and called parson-bird because of the two white curled tufts of feathers at its throat. Then, [check parson-bird inclusion - not in Journ Polyn Soc ref???] because some folk thought mockie was short for makomako, a name of the bell-bird (korimako) in some parts, some thought it was the korimako which was the mimic, and hence both birds have been called the mocking-birds.

Poutama (steps) has religious and educational connotations relating to levels of attainment. Roimata Toroa (albatross tears) denoting misadventure particularly to crops. Purapura Whetu (myriad of stars) relates to population and the peopling of a region.

A strip of ground about 30 yards long by four or five wide was scooped free of top soil, which was dumped on the garden nearby. It was then ploughed about ten inches deep, or according to the number of bricks required, and very well watered, which was usually done with a shovel from a tank on a sledge for even distribution, and left to soak all night. A good layer of chopped-up tussocks was then evenly spread over the top. After more watering a six-horse team was driven up and down the strip until the pug was well mixed.

Quote: <i>Tussock</i>.- Up-country people only recognise the small <i>blue t. (Poa colensoi) </i>and the common yellow, usually called white t. (<i>Poa caespitosa </i>) but sometimes <i>brown </i>. and sometimes <i>yellow </i> or silver. On the other hand, some men call the blue one <i>silver </i> (rare). <i>White t.</i> includes at least two varieties, a poa and a fescue (Festuca [novae-zealandiae]). The poa is a sign of good country and the fescue is not; but five shepherds out of six can't tell them part. The dreariness of the brown tussock plains seems to have been the first thing that struck every newcomer to Canterbury. ([1898 Morris Austral-English]) `In the country far distant from town, my boy,/ All desolate, drear and alone,/ Some people exist among tussocks and sheep;/ And Brittan looks after his own.' --C.RH., p. 4(2)

The name `tussock' is applied to those tufted grasses which hold water in the decaying leaves at the base. Tall tussock is dominant in subalpine regions and low tussock in montane and lowland country, though in Southland the red tussock reaches sea level and dominates much of the landscape.

Quote: <i>Tutu</i>, or <i>Toot, n</i>. Maori name for a shrub or small tree, <i>Coriaria ruscifolia,</i> Linn., or <i>C. sarmentosa,</i> Forst., of New Zealand, widely distributed. It bears greenish flowers, and shiny pulpy black berries. From these the Maoris make a wine resembling light claret, taking care to strain out and not to crush the seeds, which are poisonous, with an action similar to that of strychnine. It goes also by the name of <i>Wineberry-bush</i>, and the Maori name is Anglicised into <i>Toot.</i> In Maori, the final <i>u</i> is swallowed rather than pronounced. In English names derived from the Maori, a vowel after a mute letter is not sounded. It is called in the North Island <i>Tupakihi.</i> In Maori, the verb <i>tutu</i> means to be hit, wounded, or vehemently wild, and the name of the plant thus seems to be connected with the effects produced by its poison. To `eat your toot': used as a slang phrase; to become acclimatised, to settle down into colonial ways.

Quote: The toot-plant, tutu or tupakihi of the Maoris ... is a small bush, one of the most common and widely distributed shrubs of the islands. It produces a sort of `hoven' or narcotic effect on sheep and cattle, when too greedily eaten. It bears a fruit, which is produced in clusters, not unlike a bunch of currants, with the seed external, of a purple colour. The poisonous portion of the plant to man are the seeds and seed-stalks, while their dark purple pulp is utterly innocuous and edible. The natives express from the berries an agreeable violet juice (carefully avoiding the seed), called native wine.

The last word reminds me of a man near by who was even judged to be somewhat vain of his Maori accent and pronunciation. With one word indeed he was very particular, he could not bring himself to use that manifest corruption `toot'. With him it was ever `tutu'. He had to make rather a boggle or dodge of it when he used the colonial made verb formed on his favourite Maori noun.

Sad to relate, one far too often hears the younger generation talk with a twang that horrifies the ear of anyone used to good English ... A mother will request her daughter <i>`Kyte</i>' to ask the <i>`lydy'</i> whether she will<i> `tyke'</i> another piece of </i>`cyke'. </i>The vowels and diphthongs are so drawn and twisted that it is often difficult to recognise the King's English. ... This twang is worse in Australia than in New Zealand but is gaining ground here and ought to be strenuously eradicated by school-teachers, for it really does not sound nice, and robs sweet girlish lips of all their poetry.

Quote: The old method of tightening the chain securing the logs to trucks is called `twitching', or `taking a twitch'. First the chain is fastened leaving it quite slack. A lever is pased through the bight and used to twist the slack up on itself. When the chain is tight enough the end of the lever is tied to the chain. A `chain-rack' is now used - a giant Hayes wire-strainer. It is sometimes, but improperly, called a `twitch'. `Twitch' is probably an amalgamation of `twist' and `hitch'.

The only instance recorded of Cockney rhyming slang term for a coin is <i>Oxford scholar,</i> the derivation from dollar being obvious. The half crown was called a <i>half-dollar</i>, a <i>half-bull, half-caser</i>, <i>two-and-a-kick,</i> and <i>two-and-a-buck</i>. In the latter instance buck stands for sixpence, though apparently this term was rarely used by itself for that coin denomination, but almost always in association with a number of shillings. The florin seems to have had fewer English nicknames, only <i>two bob</i> being recorded as being in use in New Zealand.

Quote: <i>Ages of sheep. </i>Although there are many variations, the following names are usually used: A sheep is a <i>lamb</i> until weaned. After weaning a lamb is called a <i> hogget </i> until shorn. A male lamb is a <i> ram lamb </i> until castrated, then a <i> wether </i>. A female lamb is a <i> ewe lamb </i>. After shearing, a ewe or ram lamb is usually called a <i> shorn hogget </i> until cutting the first two teeth. It is then called a <i> two-tooth </i>. Some use the term two-tooth as soon as the lamb is shorn. Next year the sheep is a <i> four-tooth, then a <i> six-tooth </i> and then an <i> eight-tooth </i> or <i> full-mouthed </i> sheep. It is full-mouthed as long as the teeth remain perfect but then becomes broken-mouthed and gummy.

Quote: [Mount Ruapehu] Are you a `type' or an `odd-bod'? It was several days before I fathomed this out. The cry would go up, `Ruapehu types arriving, get cracking'. The best club cups would be sorted out, an official or prominent member would greet the new-comers, show them proudly over the house and dispense tea and hospitality with a cordial air. Then I'd hear, `Odd-bods coming up the track'. A member would supervise his arrival, see that no one entered the club room with nailed boots on, and offer a cup of tea, but there was not that ostentatious display of club china, `eats' and cordiality. I found that a `type' is a member of a recognised club and therefore someone to be treated with respect. An `odd-bod' is also a tramper or mountaineer, but of no specified breed, though entitiled to shelter. The same law holds for bush and mountain; hospitality must be dispensed for folk of the right ilk, so that the billy is always on the boil. But tourists! Well, I'd just hate to be a tourist! They were treated with loftiest contempt. I suppose I come under the heading `odd-bod', vouched for by a `type' ...
