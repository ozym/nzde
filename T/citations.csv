The tomatoes are a South American fruit, a rich source of vitamin C and long popular in New Zealand. About twenty years ago, the name <i>tamarillo</i> was deliberately contrived, much as a brand name is. On the basis of <i>tomato</i>, a diminutive<i> -ill-</i> was added; then <i>tomatillo</i> was altered, in honor of a legendary Maori tribal hero, Tama-te-kapua, to <i>tamatillo</i>; and then a change to <i>tamarillo</i> was considered more euphonious. And so a new word was born.",(G.W.Turner)

Other readers wanted to explain that `plumps' were to be found in many dictionaries, but I was aware of that anyway. Most of the people who knew of thunderplump claimed a Scottish origin for it, but it still took me quite a time to locate it in my range of dictionaries. Finally I ran it to earth in a seven-volume Century, published back in 1891, which gave it as `A short violent downpour of rain in connection with a thunder-storm (Rare),' and produced a 19th century quotation. Perhaps we didn't hear it much in Invercargill in my younger days because thunderplumps are pretty uncommon there; but a colleague who came from Winton certainly knew of it; and it was even noised abroad by the Canterbury English. ...",(Griffiths Collection)

This was very commendable and necessary in some instances, but where a township, as sometimes happened, did not `go off' at the sale, or if it did go off, was never subsequently embellished with a building of any kind, the effect had something of the ludicrous about it - for while settlement went on around the `township,' and the land was cleared and occupied, the `town' itself remained a solid block of standing bush, and the absentee owners of its acre or quarter-acre sections were only reminded of their possessions by the persistent recurrence of the notices to pay rates",

Through the first volumes <i>track</i> is always used when referring to an actual track, and <i>trail</i> occurs rarely and then only in the expression <i>blazed trail</i> or more or less figuratively - `to fare forth on the trail'. In 1935 there is the first definite use of <i>trail</i> as a synonym for <i>track</i> in a reference to the `Handbook of Arthur's Pass National Park'. It is significant that it occurs in reference to Arthur's Pass for trail seems to have come into use in Canterbury in this sense before it reached Wellington. It occurs once or twice in the first volume of the <i>Canterbury Mountaineer</i>, and there is the <i>B.B. Trail </i>in the Arthur's Pass Hand book of 1935. From 1939 till 1940 in <i>The Tramper, trail </i>is used moderately frequently for an actual track, e.g. `an old Maori trail', `a miner's trail', but only by the one writer, a Wellington member of the Canterbury Mountaineering Club. <i>Trail</i> shows no sign of ousting <i>track. </i>",Ruth Mason `Track and Trail'

I remarked that I thought it a very recent distinction, one not occurring in the Club until about 1957. He disagreed, believing it to be one he had always known. Yet, on looking through <i>The Tramper, </i> I could not find <i>deer trail</i> used until 1944, but <i>deer track</i> occurs from the first number in 1928 onwards, and he himself had used it in 1940.

Not on a path one may be sure, seldom if ever on a trail, almost always on a track, like a proper New Zealander. ... I well remember the shock of astonishment when in 1937 I first saw <i>trail </i>used in New Zealand. The word was on a rough signpost pointing out the beginning of White's Track at Piha. I am afraid I thought somewhat scornfully, `Hm, some townie who has never been out of the city or set foot off a pavement has got all his ideas of New Zealand outdoor life from reading books about North America.'...[25] It is interesting to compare the use of <i>track</i> and <i>trail</i> in <i>The Tramper</i>. Through the first volumes <i>track</i> is always used when referring to an actual track, and <i>trail </i>occurs rarely and then only in the expression <i>blazed trail</i> or more or less figuratively - `to fare forth on the trail'. In 1935 there is the first definite use of<i> trail</i> as a synonym for <i>track</i> in a reference to the `Handbook of Arthur's Pass National Park'. It is significant that it occurs in reference to Arhtur's Pass for trail seems to have come into use in Canterbury in this sense before it reached Wellington. It occurs once or twice in the first volume of the <i>Canterbury Mountaineer</i>, and there is the <i>B.B. Trail</i> in the Arthur's Pass Hand book of 1935. From 1939 till 1940 in <i>The Tramper, trail</i> is used moderately frequently for an actual track, e.g. `an old Maori trail', `a miner's trail', but only by the one writer, a Wellington member of the Canterbury Mountaineering Club. <i>Trail</i> shows no sign of ousting <i>track. </i>",1958 Sep Ruth Mason `Track and Trail' in Tararua 24
trail,Sep 1958,Tararua,,25,,"In recent years there seems to have been a tendency to use both <i>track</i> and <i>trail</i> and to differentiate between them. A trail seems to be something narrow and perhaps rather hard to follow - a way marked only by blazes or worn by animals, usually deer. A track seems to be something broader, cut or formed by man. ... A well-known older Club member made this distinction when, on hearing him speak of a deer trail, I asked him what he thought to be the difference between<i> track </i>and <i>trail.</i> I remarked that I thought it a very recent distinction, one not occurring in the Club until about 1957. He disagreed, believing it to be one he had always known. Yet, on looking through <i>The Tramper</i>, I could not find <i>deer trail</i> used until 1944, but <i>deer track</i> occurs from the first number in 1928 onwards, and he himself had used it in 1940. It remains to be seen whether this distinction will become established. In the meantime <i>deer track</i> still seems to be used far more than <i>deer trail.</i>",1958 Sep Ruth Mason `Track and Trail' (deer shooters')

A member would supervise his arrival, see that no one entered the club room with nailed boots on, and offer a cup of tea, but there was not that ostentatious display of club china, `eats' and cordiality. I found that a `type' is a member of a recognised club and therefore someone to be treated with respect. An `odd-bod' is also a tramper or mountaineer, but of no specified breed, though entitiled to shelter. The same law holds for bush and mountain; hospitality must be dispensed for folk of the right ilk, so that the billy is always on the boil. But tourists! Well, I'd just hate to be a tourist!
