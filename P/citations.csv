<i>Leionura atun
dentatus</i> (Bloch
and Schneider)
INCREDIBLE as it may
seem these fish,
with their
well-armed jaws of
sharp fang-like
teeth, were usually
caught on a slightly
curved stick about
four feet in length.
Fastened to this
stick was a piece of
stout fishing line
about three to four
feet in length,
carrying a piece of
red-coloured wood -
usually cedar -
about five to six
inches in length. A
bent nail was
secured to this
piece of wood in the
form of a hook but
no bait was used.
When a school of
Barracouta was found
the Couta stick, or
paw, was brought out
ready for fishing.
From the cockpit of
the launch the piece
of wood with the
nail was violently
swirled with a
circular motion in
and out of the
water, causing a
disturbance of the
water in a good
imitation of a
number of Sprats,
Pilchards or other
small fish jumping
in and out of the
sea. The Barracouta
would swim for such
a place. Seeing the
piece of red wood
moving rapidly
through the water
they would take it
for a fish, snap at
it or even jump out
of the water for the
lure and were caught
by the crude iron
hook. As the fish
was hooked during
the time the paw was
being drawn through
the water the
fisherman would
swing the fish over
his head above the
boat or launch and
when the caught fish
was midway in the
air, more or less
above the cockpit,
would expertly give
the stick a
dexterous smart
twist. As there was
no barb on the hook
the fish was
released and fell
into the cockpit.
<i>Ibid.</i> 311
Should there be any
Barracouta about
the... Couta sticks
were then set to
work to paw the
water and attract
Barracouta to the
spot. <i>Ibid.</i>
314 The Maori also
knew he could catch
Barracouta without
bait and he, too,
used a short piece
of stick and line
with a baitless hook
and leaned over his
canoe and threshed
the water to and
fro, which is known
as `Kaihau manga!'
When the European
fisherman called his
fishing outfit [315]
`paw', the Maori
uses the term `pa'.
This fish was a
great favourite with
them and was caught
in large numbers. On
returning to the
shore, the women
cleaned the fish and
then hung them up on
racks to dry in the
sun. Old Maoris of
Opotiki told me they
used a chip of
Tawhai
(<i>Nothofagus
fusca</i>), which is
dark red, in the

icon is usually
reputed in NZ to be
the addition of
vinegar to give the
soft centre, and in
Australia, the
trademark of
passionfruit in the
topping. (The name
`pavlova' does not
occur in either the
Futter book (1926)
or the Terrace
Tested Recipes
(1927) mentioned in
your report.)The
elliptical simple
form `pavlova' for
the meringue is
recorded earliest in
Australia from 1940
(so AND, two of
whose quotations
acknowledge NZ as
the originator) and
in NZ from 1953
(DNZE).There is no
evidence that the
name `pavlova' was
applied in Australia
before 1940. Both
countries share the
earliest recorded
date 1966 (and the
same quotation) for
the abbreviation
`pav'.The New
Zealand Dictionary
Centre at Victoria
University (Box 600,
Wellington) would be
glad of any
pre-datings of any
of the above, with

Pigroot,1944,Maori Place-Names of Otago,,8,,"No map the collector
has consulted has
shown Pigroot Hill

is the most
prominent and most
used name between
Palmerston and
Kyeburn. Again and
again the collector
has heard the
remark, `I am going
into the Central by
the Pigroot,' or `I
came down by the
Pigroot.' So
frequently is it
used that one might
imagine that certain
people used it
thinking that the
word `root' is in
reality `route,' but
be that as it may,
common usage is the
deciding factor in
place-names, and
Pigroot, with its
associations back
into the fifties,
has come to stay.
The name was
originally [9]
bestowed because the
wild pigs rooted up
the hillside looking
for the roots of the
taramea, or
speargrass, which
they enjoy eating,
and which is
probably one of the
main reasons why
speargrass is so
rare nowadays.",

pin dip,1981,History of Children's Play,SUTTON-SMITH,223,,"Pin dips were also
another popular
amusement. `A pin or
a bull or a button,
To see a rary rary
show show show!'
(1875; Tahataki). A
piece of glass
backed by cardboard
was covered with a
piece of paper that
could be flicked up
to show the `rary
rary show' or had a
slit in it through
which one could
peep. One saw
through the glass a
variety of colors,
pieces of colored
paper, flower
petals, pictures,
and later pieces off
cigarette boxes.
Sometimes these had
been arranged in
some pattern, at
other times they
were kaleidoscopic
only, and the
perceiver had
himself to add the
configurations of
intelligibility. The
price for the view
was always a pin
`which we did not
want anyhow but
always accepted,' a
relic from an age
when such things
were rare. Pin dips
were known also as
`poppy shows'
(perhaps it was the
similar flash of
color that gave the
same name - `the
poppy show' - to the
exciting experience
of seeing a girl's
dress blown upward
by the wind; pins
were not charged for
flowers of this
sort). In fact, the
pin dip or the prick
book may have
developed from the
poppy show. The
poppy show was
common before 1900
and the prick book
after that date, a
fact connected with
the ever-increasing
stock of picture
cards and magazine
pictures available

Piri-piri, but
colonists frequently
[usually] corrupt
the Maori name, and
call the plant
Bidi-bidi. As a
general rule, the
Maori names are more
incorrectly
pronounced as we go
southward from
Auckland to Otago.
This is largely due
to the fact that, in
the north, Europeans
have been brought
into closer contact
with the Maoris than
in the south. In
some few cases, the
difference in
pronunciation may be
due to differences
in the Maori
dialects. The
changes that take
place often follow
phonetic laws - thus
the Maori `p' is
softened into the
European `b' as
above, while `r' is
replaced by `l' or
`d'. Poro-poro
(<i>Solanum
aviculare</i>)
becomes Bulli-bulli,
and Puriri becomes
Boradi. This also
explains such a form
as `Kowdie' pine for
Kauri pine. Korari -
a flax-stalk -
similarly becomes
Koradi or even
Kaladi [1907 edn
?mistakenly,

is also sometimes
altered into `g,'
this Kie-kie

back from the dead.
A new chapter in the
eventful saga of the
<i>Inconstant</i> -
the ship that became
a building - has
started following
the recent opening
of the new Plimmer's
Ark Gallery on
Queens Wharf... For
many years life in
Wellington basically
revolved around the
hulk of the
<i>Inconstant</i>...
Built in 1847 and
launched on 3 Jan
1848 at Cape Breton
in Nova Scotia, the
<i>Inconstant</i>
sailed to England
and there had her
hull clad with
copper...On entering
Wellington Harbour
[in 1849] the ship
ran on to the rocky
beach between
Pencarrow and the
point now named
Inconstant Point.
The
<i>Inconstant</i>
was towed across the
harbour to Te Aro.
John Plimmer bought
the by then derelict
ship and had it
moved in 1850 to
Lambton Beach where
he built a pitched
roof over the mid
section. It became
known as Noah's
[<i>sic</i>] Ark
because of its
appearance.",

Wellington's Lambton

slab of wood.
Archaeologists
identified it as
part of the
<i>Inconstant</i>, a
ship that was towed
into Wellington and
was eventually
bought by John
Plimmer who dragged
it ashore and
modified it for use
as business
premises. The ship
became known as

have been ""collected

1940 version is
again said to have
ben arranged by
""Hemi Piripata"". in
short, no published

any credit to either
Apirana Ngata or to
P H Tomoana for
composing the song
in their
lifetimes... The

been acceptable to
many knowing the

susceptibility to

of the campaign,
says that the term
`Pommie' was applied
by veteran troops of
the campaign to
newly arrived troops
from Britain. Their
fresh pink
complexions were
likened to the fruit
pomegranate, in
contrast to the
bronzed features of
the veteran troops.
They were referred

Interested' relating
to the origin of the

word apparently came
into being during
the 1914-18 War and
is derived from the
French word pommes,
meaning, I believe,
potatoes. During the
war the front line
troops of the
British Army were
very seriously short
of food, except for
potatoes, on which
they subsisted for
many weeks. Hence on
the fields at

peculiar and, I

controversial word

another popular
amusement. `A pin or
a bull or a button,
To see a rary rary

(1875; Tahataki). A
piece of glass
backed by cardboard
was covered with a
piece of paper that
could be flicked up
to show the `rary
rary show' or had a
slit in it through
which one could
peep. One saw
through the glass a
variety of colors,
pieces of colored
paper, flower
petals, pictures,
and later pieces off
cigarette boxes.
Sometimes these had
been arranged in
some pattern, at
other times they
were kaleidoscopic
only, and the
perceiver had
himself to add the
configurations of
intelligibility. The
price for the view
was always a pin
`which we did not
want anyhow but
always accepted,' a
relic from an age
when such things
were rare. Pin dips
were known also as
`poppy shows'
(perhaps it was the
similar flash of
color that gave the
same name - `the
poppy show' - to the
exciting experience
of seeing a girl's
dress blown upward
by the wind; pins
were not charged for
flowers of this
sort). In fact, the
pin dip or the prick
book may have
developed from the
poppy show. The

common before 1900

after that date, a

Premier,1966,"Encyclopaedia of New Zealand, An",McLINTOCK,2/868,,"In the
constitutional
debates of 1854
during the first
session of the New
Zealand Parliament,
the term `Prime
Minister' was
frequently used in a
somewhat casual
fashion. This
explains in part why
it was some years
before the term
`Premier' came into
general usage.
William Fox (q.v.)
who took office in
July 1861, was
described in the
<i>Gazette</i> as
Attorney-General
`with first seat in
the Ministry'. In
November 1864 Weld
(q.v.) was gazetted
as holding `a seat
in the Executive
Council and the
office of Premier'.
Stafford (q.v.) his
successor, in
October 1865 was
termed `First
Minister'. In June
1869, when Fox again
headed a Ministry,
he was described
officially as
`Premier and member
of the Executive
Council.' Thereafter
the term `Premier'
was regularly used.
Nevertheless, in the
Schedule of the
Civil List Act of
1873, provision was
made for the salary
of the Leader of the
Government `being
the Prime Minister'.
The first Premier to
use the title `Prime
Minister' officially
was Richard John
Seddon (q.v.). It
was used in the
<i>New Zealand Year
Book</i> of 1900 and
the Imperial
Conference of 1903
confirmed the
practice.",

comrades. The

to nickname their

pasturage system was
quickly adapted to

merged into one
