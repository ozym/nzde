Maori,,noun,,,[none],,,[none],,[none],,,"There is a discussion on the word in the `Journal of Polynesian Society,' vol. i. no. 3, vol. ii. no. I, and vol. iii. no. I. Bishop Williams (4th ed.) says that the word means, `of the normal or usual kind.' The Pakehas were not men to whom the natives were accustomed. So Maori was used as opposed to the Europeans, the white-skins. <i>Kuri Maori</i> was a name used for a dog after the arrival of other quadrupeds called also <i>kuri. Wai maori</i> was fresh-water, oridinary as opposed to sea-water. Another explanation is that the word meant `indigenous,' and that there are kindred words with that meaning in other Polynesian languages. First, `indigenous,' or ""of the native race,' and then with a secondary meaning, `ours.' (See `Tregear's Maori Comparative Dictionary,' s.v.) The form of the plural varies, The form <i>Maoris</i> is considered the more correct, but the form <i>Maories</i> is frequently used by good writers."

Passing through London Bookshop today I spotted Gordon Ell's new book on NZ Trivia and Kiwiana and he says Marching Girls started in Dunedin in the 1920s. have I found any early Auckland ones, nothing before 1941 in Wellington. guess is that one or other or both of Jean Stevenson and Kathleen Montgomery started them in Auckland and through the YWCA spread them rapidly throughout the main centres."

mongrel,,noun,,"1952 Feb 16 R.Gilberd notes on Mongrel Reading `Talking of Words' (Cecil Hull) p21`We might objectively and scientifically describe him, if he were ours, as a dog of mixed breeds - ... we would not be pleased if an acquaintance calls that dog a mongrel.' In town where dogs are kept largely for appearance and display `mongrel' I think has only one meaning - that a dog is of mixed breeding (with a note of disapproval or contempt). In the country mongrel has two independent meanings. (i) A dog of mixed blood. Objective - no emotional content. Indeed `pedigreed' is acquiring something of the mongrel taint, in that if a good dog has a pedigree it is mentioned with a faint note of surprise. (ii) A `no-good' whether man or animal. `He turned out mongrel' (Rod Macaulay speaking of a pedigreed mastiff that took to sheep worrying.) `When Bill brought him home I knew he'd turn out a mongrel. Sort of a cow-y look about his head.' (Walter Hull discussing a pedigreed `Totara Park' Friesian bull which proved sterile.) Talking of dogs: An `eye-dog' is a specialised type of header which works very quietly, never taking its eyes off the sheep it is trying to pen. Sheep men generally seem to think the dog hypnotises the sheep into being penned quietly. I believe that the fixity of its gaze and its complete concentration enable it to detect and counter any rebelliousness on the part of the sheep before the sheep have quite made up their minds.",[none],,,[none],,[none],,,
