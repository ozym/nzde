Some historians support my Captain Cook theory, though there are others who place the first use of the name `snapper' at a later date, certainly not earlier. They think the name may have been given the fish by Captain W. L. Edwardson, the commander of a New South Wales Government cutter called the Snapper which was in New Zealand waters in 1822 and 1823 investigating sealing prospects.

These names have a bearing on some distinguishing characteristic of the fish. For instance the first two names are supposed to be given on account of the colouring of the fish resembling, in some ways, the tartan of a Scot; while Fivefingers is given on account of the so-called five (really more) fingers (rays) of the pectoral fins, on which the fish has a habit of resting on the floor of the aquarium tank. The name Soldierfish is derived from the similarities of this fish to the activities of a soldier or picket on sentinel duty. I have often seen Seaperch stand or, rather, rest at attention on its pectoral fins for lengthy periods.

It picks up one of these stones and swallows it and goes into the water to try the effect. If it finds it requires more ballast it comes ashore again and repeats the dose.

There arises the further question as to the origin of the word which ... has been explained as an Irish `shaughraun'. Now why should an Irish word have been used at that time by the English settlers in Canterbury? ... My belief is that the word was not originally `Shagroon' but `Shabroon', `shabberoon', `shabbaroon' (all spellings occur) which is on record from the 18th century onwards, meaning `a mean, shabby fellow', `a disreputable or mean-spirited fellow', and this, which would be probably familiar to the English Pilgrims, is just the sort of term which would naturally be used to describe their rivals. This `shabroon' derives from the slang `shab', a low fellow, recorded as early as 1637, and no doubt closely alied to the standard `shabby', and ultimately from `shab' and `scab', two forms of the old English word. ... I conjecture that the `shabroon' [?does Wall mean `shagroon] of the English Pilgrims was by some pronounced with the `b' and by others with the `g', nobody ever having seen the word written or printed.

During the first year of the Settlement, Canterbury was invaded by a body of sheep-farmers from Port Philip (Victoria) who were regarded by the settlers partly with admiration as successful Colonists, and partly with horror as disbelievers in the art of colonisation and the `Canterbury System'. The visitors found the country admirably adapted for sheep-farming, and they treated with some contempt the raw emigrants from England who looked to agriculture as the foundation of their fortunes. One of the vistiors, who seem to have delighted in the soubriquet of `Shagroon', ventured to prophesy, in a letter, which found its way into print, that the `Canterbury Pilgrims' would soon be ruined and their country left for occupation by his more enlightened comrades. The `pilgrims' sought no harsher revenge than to nickname their Port Philip visitors `prophets' and to take example from their experience in pastoral pursuits. The Canterbury pasturage system was quickly adapted to the requirements of sheepfarming on a large scale, and `pilgrims' and `prophets' were soon merged into one class of Canterbury runholders."

sharemilker,1963,In the Sticks,BACON,183,,"<i>sharemilker</i>-One who contracts to milk a herd of cows for a share of profits. In general, sharemilkers fall into three categories: first, the 29 per cent sharemilker, second, the 39 per cent man, third, the 50 per cent man. The 29 per cent man contracts to milk the farmer's herd and attend to their wants only; he helps at haymaking, etc. as part of the herd's `wants', but in general, once the cows have been attended to for the two daily milkings, his time is his own. The 39 per cent man contracts to milk the herd owned by the farmer and to do all the other general farm work. For this he receives 39 per cent of the herd profits. The 50 per cent sharemilker runs his own herd of cows on another man's land. He does all the farm work, and receives 50 per cent of the profits. Many farmers who today have their own farms in New Zealand started off as 39 per cent share milkers, saved enough to buy their own herds and so became 50 per cent milkers, then saved again to purchase land themselves (or on which they put sharemilkers!)",

If, on the other hand, he had done the job to the best of his ability but he was not satisfied with the job, he used the phrase `She's not too good' or `She's pretty poor' Never was the phrase `She's right' used in the sense that politicians and various other people not in the know use it to refer to a job badly done or done with a `couldn't-care-less' attitude. This was never necessary because in the Army we had other phrases to cover such contingencies when things did not go according to plan, such as NAFU and SAFU, the first being a non-adjusting fiasco, and the second being a self-adjusting fiasco. To say the least of it, I feel strongly that it is disrespectful to the originators of the saying `She's right' to use it in the present accepted sense, and I feel also that all Grim Digs should rise up in righteous wrath, but `don't do your scone boys.'

shepherd's hut,1939,First White Boy Born in Otago,BEATTIE,11,,"The custom in the old days was to call the buildings on a run `the station,' and the land that went with it was `the run.' On a big property you could find several `stations,' and the principal one was called `the home station,' while the others were `out-stations.' This was the old Australian usage which was carried over to New Zealand at first, but gradually the signification was altered by loosely calling the whole run a station, and then the real station became a homestead and the out-stations became shepherds' huts. In this present book it will be noticed that generally the writer has preserved the olden custom of calling the main buildings the station and the land the run. The runs over in Australia being, as a rule, much larger than those in New Zealand, the `station' and `out-station' phraseology was preserved much longer than over here, where even in advertisements in the late 'fifties we see the English word `homestead' ousting the colonial word `station.' <i>Ibid.</i> 12 . provisions became `rations' ... when served out to the man at the `shepherds' huts' (or out-stations).",

shinplaster,1941,Numismatic History of NZ,SUTHERLAND,158,,"<i>Shinplasters</i>.- The fact that private traders found it necessary themselves, to issue paper notes in denominations below five shillings suggests that at the outset ... the Fitzroy notes were not issued for values below five shillings. The private paper notes were issued for small change, redeemable mostly in `Five Shillings, in Government debentures.' Both the debentures and the private notes were issued on poor paper, and soon became known as `Government Rags' and `Shinplasters' respectively. The term `Shinplaster' for paper money appears to have come to New Zealand from America, via New South Wales. *[fn] In the latter Colony the issue of paper money of a denomination lower than twenty shillings was prohibited in 1826 to promote the circulation of sterling instead of a colonial currency, and the prohibition was welcomed by the people as `preventing the Colony being inundated with beggarly rags' and dollar and half-dollar notes `used often as a paltry contrivance to evade payment of debt,' <i>vide ""The Australian,"" </i>19 July 1826. [fn] Various reasons have been given for the origin of this curious term for paper money issued in the forties. The most likely explanation comes from America (p. 650 <i>The Numismatist,</i> 1938), where it is stated that in the good old days post-boys and out-riders, wearing high boots, were required, at times, to pay toll-fees at toll-gates, and in order to facilitate progress they placed paper money or coins in bags in their boot-tops, against their shins - hence the term `shin-plaster.'",

sidle,Sep 1958,Tararua,,29,,"To <i>sidle </i>, to go around the side or across the face of a hill, is a characteristic New Zealand expression, strange to the Englishman or Australian. The example of 1821 in O.E.D.: `Ye know the footpath sidles down the hill', suggests that something of the New Zealand meaning was not unknown in England, but it cannot have been well known, or mountaineers would not have started to use <i>traverse </i>, both as a noun and as a verb, towards the end of last century. <i>Sidle </i> is well known among high-country musterers. As it is a word most likely to be used in open hilly or mountainous country, one may guess that musterers and up-country people gave it currency, whence it was adopted by mountain club people. If ski-ing had not brought its more or less international vocabulary with it we should no doubt be sidling slopes, on skis, that we now traverse... From 1936 to 1938 in <i>The Tramper </i> there are a number of references to `sidling tracks' and `sidling routes'. Towards the end of 1938 comes `after sidling round the head of the said stream', and, a year later, `we sidle the top of Three Johns', and from then on the verb flourishes. In 1940 comes `on a long sidle', and from then on the noun is as common as the verb. <i>Ibid.</i> 41 From the top basin we sidled up tiresome scree, ... and at last emerged on the top of the divide.",Ruth Mason `Track and Trail'

spang-weazling,1953,Unorganized Games,,1/406,,Perhaps the most intriguing game of this nature [sc. tormenting insects or animals] is `Spang Weazling'. This game was played at Denniston in 1930-35. A crawley was placed on the end of a stick the middle section of which lay balanced over a stone. Before the crawley could crawl off the stick a stone had to be thrown onto the other end of the stick so as to catapult the crawley off the stick and over the cliff. A variation of the same game was being played at Denniston when I visited there in 1949. It was called alternatively `Hit the Crawley' or `Strike the Crayfish'. In this version the other end of the stick was hit with a batting stick (as in Tip Cat) and when the crawley was catapulted into the air it was hit again with the bat.,

station,1947,Early Runholding in Otago,BEATTIE,11,,"The custom in the old days was to call the buildings on a run `the station,' and the land that went with it was `the run.' On a big property you could find several `stations,' and the principal one was called `the home station,' while the others were `out-stations.' This was the old Australian usage which was carried over to New Zealand at first, but gradually the signification was altered by loosely calling the whole run a station, and then the real station became a homestead and the out-stations became shepherds' huts. In this present book it will be noticed that generally the writer has preserved the olden custom of calling the main buildings the station and the land the run. The runs over in Australia being, as a rule, much larger than those in New Zealand, the `station' and `out-station' phraseology was preserved much longer than over here, where even in advertisements in the late `fifties we see the English word `homestead' ousting the colonial word `station.'",
station,"Jul 21, 1856",Puketoi Station Diary,,,,"It is usually understood that in the early days the word `station' denoted the owner's house and its immediate buildings, while `run' meant the whole property. Strange to say, I only noted the word `station' twice, and each time with a diverse meaning. On July 21, 1865, the diary says: `Sold 17 head of cattle - remaining on station 15 head.' Then on September 11, 1865, we read: `Wilkinson returned to the Home Station.' The first of these entries means the whole run - the second the homestead or main buildings.",1947 Beattie Early Runholding 115 quoting 1856 July 21 Puketoi Station Diary
