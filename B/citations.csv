Various species of

New Zealand called
birches. They are
all really beeches

Solandri.</i> - The
most common name of
this tree is
`black-birch,' but
it has several other
names. In the
Wellington and
Marlborough
districts it is
called
`black-birch'; in
Canterbury it is
called
`black-birch,'
`white-birch,'
`red-birch,' and
`brown-birch'; in
Otago it is known as
`white-birch,'
`black-birch,' or
black-heart birch.'
Young specimens of
this tree that have
no dark heart-wood
are often called
`white-birch.' This
tree is a beech, and
it would do away
with confusion if it
was called
`black-beech'.
<i>Fagus Menziesii.

name of this tree is
`silver-birch,' but
it is often called
`brown-birch,'
`red-birch,' and
`white-birch' [308]
in different
localities. It would
be best to call it
`silver-beech,'though
it is gaining an
Australasian
reputation as
`Southland beech.'
<i>Fagus fusca.

this tree is called
`black-birch'; in
Wellington
`red-birch'; in
Nelson, Marlborough

called
`brown-birch'; and
in Otago it is
called both
`red-birch' and
`bull-birch.' The
most suitable name
is `red-beech.'",
birch,1876,TrNZI,,64,,"The utmost confusion
prevails among the
common names of the
birches. There are
scarcely two
districts, a few
miles apart, in
which the same name
is applied to the
same tree, and a
similar result may
be obtained by
consulting two
bushmen in the same
bush. With a view to
obviating this
difficulty Mr Kirk
suggests `the
adoption of new
names based of the
obvious
characteristics of

Fagus fusca
`tooth-leaved beech'
...",(Blair)
birch,1885,TrNZI,,17/300,,"[this cit. not spec.

[In Oxford Forest] I
learned that the
tree [F. solandri,
entire-leaved beech
] was termed [red,
brown, white, black,
and yellow] birch at
different stages of
its growth, but the
application of these
terms differed
greatly; perhaps
Black Birch was most
generally applied to
the mature condition
before decay
commenced, and White
birch to the young
state; but there
were too many
exceptions to allow
the names to be
anything but
misleading.","(Kirk, NZ Beeches)"
birch,1891,NZ Journal of Science,,1/50,,"The perversity with
which the true
`beeches' have
become popularly
known as `birches,'
and different kinds
of `mapau' as

name which includes

Natural Order, is
enough to fill with
despair any botanist
who desires to
foster a system of
popular names that
will be free from
misleading and
inaccurate
suggestions.",
birch,1926,TrNZI,,56-57/663,,"'... the term birch
may be regarded as a
generic name applied
by bushmen to any
small-leaved tree,
and qualified by the
prefixes `black',
`white' or `red' at
the caprice of the
individual or as may
be suggested by the
colour of its
foliage, bark or
timber.' So the term
`black birch' was in
many districts
applied to
Pittosporum
tenuifolium [ ] and
to Weinmannia
racemosa [Kamahi] in
Otago - the latter
tree being also
known as `brown
birch' or `red
birch.' Myrsine
Urvillei [ ] was
known as `red
birch', and
Carpodetus serratus
[ ] and Quintinia
serrata [ ] as
`white birch.' It
was principally to
the trees of the
species Nothofagus
(then known a
Fagus), that the
term `birch' was
applied, and a
distinguishing of
the various kinds by
the prefixing of a
descriptive word was
a step in the right
direction; but in
this instance the
step was on a path
that led to a
quagmire. To take
only the instance of
N. Solandri
(formerly Fagus
Solandri). [v. 1885
Kirk] ... The
confusion created
has been endless ;
it has at times even
resulted in
commercial loss ;
[v. (Morris) 1889
Kirk `Forest Flora
of NZ p.91] yet so
strong is habit that
confusion was
preferred before a
change of name. And,
indeed, the bushmen
might well ask what
name they should
adopt ; for the
scientists came and
added to the
confusion by
pointing out that
the trees usually
called `birch' were
not birch at all,
but `beech' - when a
fresh crop of names
resulted.: `black
beech', `red beech',
`dusky beech', etc.
The scientists
themselves, however,
in calling the
species Nothofagus,
`beech', took care -
that is, usually
took care - to make
the distinguishing
prefix one that
would not lead to a
repetition of the
old confusion. N.
Solanderi was
accordingly called
`entire-leaved
beech' ; N.
Cliffortioides,
`mountain beech' ;
N. Menziesii,
`round-leaved beech'
; N. fusca
`tooth-leaved
beech'. It was some
time before even
these names were
agreed upon ; and
`silver beech'
finally took the
place of
`round-leaved beech'
for N. Menziesii. A
note may here be
made of the fact
that, whilst the
entire-leaved beech
was Fagus Solandri,
on Fagus being
changed to
Nothofagus, Solandri
was altered to
Solanderi ; but this
has been altered
back again to
Solandri ; for that
was the original and
not incorrect
spelling of the
word.",Andersen Popular Names ff Kirk in 1875 [Reports on the Durability of N.Z. Timber 16]

stuck. Nordmeyer's
budget [of June
1958] was remembered
as `the black

years. It can be
argued that it was
good for `the
country'. For the
government it was a
suicidal mistake. It
was the biggest
blunder in Nash's
political career.

immediately and
directly
responsible, he was
the leader and did
not say `No'.",

box of birds,Dec 1957,Evening Post,,,,"`A BOX OF BIRDS'
Sir, - I am aware
that idioms in any
language are often
difficult to
analyse, but there
is one phrase used
in New Zealand which
leaves me completely
puzzled. It is the
expression `a box of
birds,' given in
reply to the
greeting `How are
you?' and is
evidently intended
to mean a state of
well-being. This
appears to be so
completely
irrelevant that I
would be pleased if
any of your readers
could elucidate, if
that is possible.
The term suggests to
me something to be
prepared for the
dinner table, but I
am willing to be
corrected. - I am,
etc. KIWIPOM. ? 1957

who lived to be over
a hundred, and who
was a bullock-driver
from the age of
sixteen until he was
twenty-two, had much
to tell me of this
adventurous portion
of his long career,
... `You ask how the
bullocks were
attached to the
vehicle, and as
bullock-driving is
now a lost art, I
had better try and
explain ... Very
seldom was harness
used, and then
without winkers, and
it was called
branks. The pulling
strain came on the
bows, and a yoke
joined two bows and
went over each neck
of a pair of
bullocks. If there
were five pairs,
say, a chain ran
from the yoke of the
first pair to the
yoke of the second
pair, and another
chain from the
second to the third,
and another chain
from the third to
the fourth. These
chains were lighter
between the first
pairs and heavier as
you got further
back. The two rear
bullocks were yoked
to the pole of the
dray or waggon. As
there were no reins,
the driving was all
by commands and
cracking the whip.
The calls were `Get
up' or `Gee up' to
start, `Whoa' to
stop, `Come here' to
turn to left, and
`Gee off' to turn
right. If you came
to a sharp corner,
you would often say
persuasively, `Way!
Way! Come here.''
There is a general
impression that
bullocks could not
be successfully
driven without
roaring oaths and
curses at them, but
this idea is a relic
of early-day humour.",

... August 23, 1856.
I mounted my good

the intention of
leading the two
packed horses, when
to my astonishment
her ladyship started
buckjumping, and
after a long fight,
finding she could
not throw me,
suddenly stood on
her hind legs and
fell over backwards.
... Buckjumping is a
horrid vice,
although it is a
very amusing
performance - to the
spectator. The horse
tries to roll itself
up into a ball, with
all four feet close
together, head down
as near the ground
as possible between
the forelegs, tail
well down, back
stuck up like the
hump of a camel when
in good condition.
Attitude is
everything. Then
commences the
performance. With an
active spring and
rather a forward
motion up you go in
the air, and down
again with a jerk,
then up and down
like an india-rubber
ball, occasionally
varying the action
by jumping forward
and kicking out
behind with both
legs at once,
returning to the
oval position as
rapidly as possible,
then turning round

was one of the

to escape from
Botany Bay and take
to the bush. It was
then thought
impossible to do
this and live, as
apart from the
problem of food and
water, the blacks
were numerous and
savage and reported
to be cannibals.
Extensive search was
made, but no trace
was found of
Buckley; and it was
concluded that the
natives had got him.
Any other convict
who talked of
escaping was
invariably told that
he would have
`Buckley's chance' -
hence the saying.
However, many years
afterwards Buckley
was found to be
still living. He had
managed to make
friends with a small
band of natives who
were moving to a
remote part of the
country, married one
of their gins, and
lived their life.

put a supper, the

spotty is also known
in Dunedin as the
butter-fish, as when
writing in 1877, he
said: `The spotty,
or butter-fish of
our local fishermen,
has been very
plentiful this year,
and had been brought
to town in large
numbers at times;
was in the market
128 days, as against
thirty-four days for
last year.' ...
adding in the most
tantalizing manner
possible, `There are
two sorts of spotty
- a big and a
little.' And then,
after saying the
fishermen called
them kelp-fish,
writes: `Spotties in
market 154 days'.",

The name kelp-fish
is given on account
of its habit of
feeding on kelp or

because it likes to
make its home among
kelp. In such a

because the fish is

why this dark
coloured fish should

Butterfish I am
unable to say. It is
certainly not as
some people suggest
because it needs
butter with it when
cooked or eaten. In
Auckland the fish
known to South
Islanders as Spotty
(<i>Pseudolabrus

called Butterfish on
account of its
bright golden
colouring on the
lower parts of the
body and fins

resembling the
colour of butter.

by fishermen.",

<i>Ibid.</i> 130 It
is unfortunate that
the Butterfish has

of local names which
have originated
either from their

the colour of their

example, Kelpfish,
Kelp-salmon,
Greenbone, and
several other names
not so easy to
