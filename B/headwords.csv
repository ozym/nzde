Their workers did not in fact ""load bulk goods"" - it was the result of their working that the goods became ""bulk"". Such firms still exist; their current formal name is ""freight forwarders"" although one hears bulk tonnage operatore or ""BTO"" occasionally. Examples include Mainfreight and Daily Freight... Given that the expanded name of ""bulk tonnage operator"" is some thirty years older than [your] example, I would be surprised if its contraction is not also somewhere recorded earlier than 1991."

In the DNZE p. 103 you deal with the word 'bung' which can mean become useless, broken, ruined and 'bung out' meaning to die. But your earliest reference for these words is 1887 and the origin is given as Australian pidgin. I wonder what the earliest Australian reference is and whether Rangihaeata would have picked it up from this source so early. It seems that if he was using it, then it already had some currency in NZ by then."" Harry Orsman replied that ""I think (and I can recall this from the limits of an imperfect memory) that this use in early Maori-Pakeha New Zealand relations was a pidgin word from 'bang(a)bang' meaning to shoot.

In the South Island `a burn' was a periodical burning off of old tussock to prepare the way for good crop of new grass. In 20th century usage, however, has been applied (e.g. in the Pelorus Sounds) to burning off noxious weeds, fern, scrub etc. to get a good growth of green feed (cf. match-farming). In the North Island, `a burn' was chiefly applied to clearing away (felled) bush by burning, a burning off (or over) of unwanted bush: that is, to clearing or bringing land into cultivation, not merely to improving pasture. burn off seems chiefly used in this North Island sense (cf bush-burning))",[none],,,[none],,[none],also bush burn,,
