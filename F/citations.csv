Although there are
many variations, the
following names are
usually used: A
sheep is a lamb
until weaned. After
weaning a lamb is
called a hogget
until shorn. A male
lamb is a ram lamb
until castrated,
then a wether. A
female lamb is a ewe
lamb. After
shearing, a ewe or
ram lamb is usually
called a shorn
hogget until cutting
the first two teeth.
It is then called a
two-tooth. Some use
the term two-tooth
as soon as the lamb
is shorn. Next year
the sheep is a

an eight-tooth or
