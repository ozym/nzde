VolPage: 2(1) : 5

Quote: What may have been the shortest-lived New Zealand usage on record hit the headlines in May last year at the time of the women's rugbv union World Cup played in the Netherlands. As the Kiwi women rucked and ran their way with stunning ease to the title of world champions, they began to be described, by journalists initially, as the Gal Blacks, a name rather cleverly punning on (loosely rhyming with) that of their hitherto more illustrious male counterparts the All Blacks, whose classic black uniform they too wear.No sooner was the women's triumph complete, however, than it was made clear to all and sundry that the name bestowed on them was unacceptable both to the team itself and the New Zealand Rugby Football Union which administers both male and female rugby. NZRFU chief executive David Moffatt was reported as rejecting the name as inappropriate on the grounds that 'gal is an American slang term and certainly not what we want to call our team'. A replacement was promised, and in the meantime most journalists and others accepted the name's red-carding. It was sighted however on the cover of the July 1998 issue of New Zealand Sport Monthly ('Where now for the Gal Blacks?'), whose editorial lauding the team's success said the name would have to do until something better came along... What is striking about all these current brand names is that without exception they derive directly or indirectly from the prototypical All Black name. Even Gal Blacks, admittedly Americanised, was paying homage to its mana.

Roxburgh and Cromwell are well behind, and I slow down ... to enjoy the sight of the water gushing from the spillway of the newly-erected power station at the Roaring Meg corner of the [Kawarau] Gorge. This heavy stream, which breaks so suddenly on a stranger from its very rough surroundings, got its name (according to early-day tradition) from the fact that Meg, one of the two girls on their way to a dancing saloon at Arrow, created such a fuss at crossing this turbulent water that vibrations of her voice loosened rocks on the mountain side to add still further to the roaring of the stream and of Meg herself. There are different versions concerning the naming of this stream, and maybe some of this one is my own. ... A few miles further on the next stream to be crossed is the Gentle Annie, called after Meg's pal, who no doubt was a much quieter type of tourist than Meg herself.

Regarded as the biggest and most aggressive of the giant squid species, it will be displayed for two weeks before being returned to the non-display collection....

With this background, Cosgrove would appear to be arranging for a joint meeting between Woodend or Rangiora Girl Peace Scouts and the Peace Scouts of East Belt methodist, sometime during or after 1908.

Quote: In 1909 Colonel Cosgrove, a New Zealander who had fought in the Boer War and had there met Sir Baden-Powell, as he was then known, and had talked with him about his ideas on Scouting, thought that the girls of New Zealand should have some Movement of their own. Scouting had already found its way to New Zealand, but there was no talk of Guiding for girls. So Colonel Cosgrove called his Movement "The Girl Peace Scouts"... The girls wore khaki dresses, which were very long, but no one seemed to mind. They had hats which turned up at the sides, carried staves on all occasions, and they always had a bugler! Troop flags and haversacks were also part of the uniform. The girls did not believe in anything too tame, and had fearsome emblems such as curlews, moreporks, and peewits for their patrols. The knots were three pieces of ribbon tied in bows, to remind the girls of their threefold promise. The enrolment badge was very similar to the Girl Guide badge of to-day, with the letters P.S. (peace scout) on it... In October 1923 came official word that the Girl Guides' Association of New Zealand.. had been duly registered in London with Imperial headquarters.

Quote: GLOBE-FISH <i>Contusus richei </i>(Freminville) ... It has several other popular names such as Balloon-fish and Mouse-fish. In America it is known as Rabbit-fish and Stink-fish. The most humorous name is that of Publican-fish. The names Globe-fish and Balloon-fish were given because of the animal's habit of inflating itself with air to such an extent that the body was like a lamp globe or an inflated balloon. The Mouse-fish is the most popular among some fishermen and when the fish is distended it does present a striking resemblance to a mouse, with its cunning looking face. The name Rabbit-fish in America is so given because its teeth are like those of a rabbit. The most witty name, Publican-fish given to it by Australian fishermen, is said to have originated from the resemblance of an inflated Globe-fish to the rotundity of many successful publicans.

The New Zealanders, for example, observing that the sailors on board the whaling vessels that touched at their ports uniformly carried an iron pot with them to cook their provisions when they went on shore, conceived the words Go ashore, which they were accustomed to hear when preparations were making for landing, was the proper name for an iron pot and they have accordingly been adopted as such in the New Zealand [Maori] language.

Quote: Go-ashore: This [common utensil] was a round kettle-like pot of considerable dimensions with legs like a camp oven and with a handle to enable it to be hung over the fire. This was commonly called a `go-ashore'. Just how it got its name is not quite clear but the accepted explanation is as follows:- Early in the `white' history of New Zealand, some Maoris were anxious to know the name of the utensil. The white man addressed was not so much concerned about the enquiry as about landing, so instructed his companies to `go ashore'. Mistaking the instruction for an answer to their question the Maoris applied the name `goashore' to this particular kind of kettle. Whatever the origin of the name, the `go-ashore' was a valued part of the early settlers' equipment.

## "God's own country"


WordClass: noun

Definition: A political or journalistic catchphrase popularised from about the times of Richard Seddon and now used mainly ironically or jocularly: often abbrev. to God's own, Godzone, Gordzone q.v.
Origin: [none]


Domain: [none]

Region: [none]
See: also Ward's own country.

Quote: The earliest recorded use of the phrase was as the title of a poem about New Zealand written by Thomas Bracken sometime in the 1880s. It was published in a book of his poems in 1890, and then again in 1893 in a book containing a selection of his works, entitled Lays and Lyrics: God's Own Country and Other Poems. God's Own Country as a phrase was often used and popularised by New Zealand's longest serving prime minister, Richard John Seddon. He last used it on June 10, 1906 when he sent a telegram to the Victorian premier, Thomas Bent, the day before leaving Sydney to return home to New Zealand. "Just leaving for God's own country," he wrote. He never made it, dying the next day on the ship Oswestry Grange.

I heard it casually from the lips of apparently respectable setters, as they rode on the highways, `Such and such a one is a good mark,' simply a person who pays his men their wages, without delays or draw-backs; a man to whom you may sell anything safely; for there are in the colony people who are regularly summoned before the magistrates by every servant they employ for wages. They seem to like to do everything publicly, legally, and so become notoriously not `good marks.'' ca1941 He's OK. A good mark up to about 50 quid ca1949 You're lucky to get him for the job.

Quote: Shinplasters.- The fact that private traders found it necessary themselves, to issue paper notes in denominations below five shillings suggests that at the outset ... the Fitzroy notes were not issued for values below five shillings. The private paper notes were issued for small change, redeemable mostly in `Five Shillings, in Government debentures.' Both the debentures and the private notes were issued on poor paper, and soon became known as `Government Rags' and `Shinplasters' respectively. The term `Shinplaster' for paper money appears to have come to New Zealand from America, via New South Wales. *[fn] In the latter Colony the issue of paper money of a denomination lower than twenty shillings was prohibited in 1826 to promote the circulation of sterling instead of a colonial currency, and the prohibition was welcomed by the people as `preventing the Colony being inundated with beggarly rags' and dollar and half-dollar notes `used often as a paltry contrivance to evade payment of debt,' vide `The Australian,' 19 July 1826. [fn] Various reasons have been given for the origin of this curious term for paper money issued in the forties. The most likely explanation comes from America (p. 650 The Numismatist, 1938), where it is stated that in the good old days post-boys and out-riders, wearing high boots, were required, at times, to pay toll-fees at toll-gates, and in order to facilitate progress they placed paper money or coins in bags in their boot-tops, against their shins - hence the term `shin-plaster.'

Quote: The [Governor Fitzroy's (1844)] Debentures, popularly known as `government rags', were given various nicknames such as assignats, `shinplasters', and `flash notes'. All these terms had reference to worthless paper money, some of which had been issued in the past. Assignats was the name given to large amounts of paper money issued in France during the French Revolution, but which depreciated to such as extent to be almost worthless. `Shinplasters'--sometimes written `skinplasters'--had its origin in North America, and again referred to depreciated paper money, while `flash notes' was a popular term in use for any counterfeit money or worthless forged paper money.

Quote: 'What's the GV?' is the first question most buyers ask when they're in the market for a new house. Actually, as of 1998 there is no such thing. The job of valuing properties moved out of the government arena three years ago. The valuation of properties became contestable, and the former Government Valuation Department became a business called Quotable Value New Zealand (QV). However, councils right around the country are still required by law to put what is now called a Rateable Value on properties, and in Nelson city the tender for this work was won by QV. It is to be emphasized that the valuations are carried out totally independently of the council, with the property owner having the right to dispute the valuation with the valuer before they are set.

I don't see the point in using this obscure term, except to show how knowledgeable you are, since the meaning is simply to defer the darn things. The technical meaning of a grandfather clause is temporary exemption from a law for people who were doing whatever they were doing at the time when legislation was passed. Originally, it referred to laws restricting voting to those who had the franchise before the American Civil War.

It is unfortunate that the generic name Porina</i>, which was coming into general use, must now be changed to <i>Oxycanus</i>, since the name <i>Porina</i> is preoccupied as a molluscan genus.

Quote: PLANTAIN (<i>Plantago lanceolata</i>) is commonly called rib grass, lamb's tongue, horse plantain, and soldiers. It is common in pastures and waste places throughout. It forms a rosette of lanceolate leaves about 6 inches long, with prominent or converging veins, giving the name `rib grass' From the rosette rises the slender flower stalk a foot or more in length, with a crowded mass of tiny brown or black flowers at its tip. These heads are used by children for playing `soldiers,' and so in Scotland the weed is called `Carl Doddie'-that is `Charles and George'- a souvenir of 1745.

Quote: Speaking of the Moonlight Ranges (Taringatura) he [Mr Roberts] says: - `The snowgrass was very rank and in flower, a greenish white, like rye grass. The speargrass was a great nuisance. There was a large celmesia, or cotton plant, growing very abundantly, the leaves long and narrow with a soft down on the under part of the leaf and a white flower like a large moon daisy.' <i>Ibid.</i> 23 July 6. - I set out on foot ... and the long wet snowgrass soaked me to the waist. I crossed a swamp jumping from one Maori-head to another, but some were too weak to carry me, so I frequently slipped down into the mud, ... <i>Ibid.</i> Writing of the Waimea Plain in 1856: - `The ground was well grassed, but the speargrass was too plentiful. The pasturage was very good. There was a good deal of scrub in the bends of the Mataura known as `wire plant' (Olearia virgata). There were also manuka and koromiko. Maori-heads, a kind of grass tree about three feet high, abounded in the swamps, and in some we saw toitoi grass and raupo. We did not pass any cabbage trees to-day ... we proceeded slowly through tomatakuru scrub, speargrass, Spaniard, snowgrass, and other native grasses ... we camped in a bend with good feed at the Elbow and a swamp on one side. Maori cabbage abounded ...'

Quote: Snowgrass, Snow tussock.- <i> Danthonia [flavescens] </i>and <i>D. [rubra]</i>.) There are two kinds but shepherds do not distinguish between them. In Southland the kind they have there looks redder and is called locally <i>red tussock</i>. Sheep do not care for it, but it is so big that it sticks out of snow well and gives them a nibble. (C.) `The grass is coarse and cold-looking--great tufts of what is called snowgrass ... [which] grows in a clump sometimes five or six feet in diameter and four or five feet high; sheep and cattle pick at it when they are hungry, but seldom touch it while they can get anything else. Its seed is like that of oats. It is an unhappy-looking grass, if grass it be.'`[Butler A First Year in Canterbury Settlement],pp.74-5.

Quote: On the mountains of both islands the WIRY DANTHONIA (<i>D. setifolia</i>), so called because of the stiff, erect, acicular leaves, is the commoner species over wide areas. In Marlborough it is sometimes termed the NEEDLE GRASS, a name that is also and more aptly applied to a smaller cushion-forming plant of limestone country in the north of the South Island known as <i>Poa acicularifolia. </i>

The damage ... is probably only second in importance to that done by the true `grass grub,' <i>Odontria zealandica</i>. Until recently, practically all damage done to pasture was attributed to <i>Odontria</i>, [310] and only recently have farmers commenced to distinguish between the two pests, and to refer to [<i>Oxycanus</i>] as `grass caterpillar,' or `<i>Porina</i> caterpillar.' It is unfortunate that the generic name <i>Porina</i>, which was coming into general use, must now be changed to <i>Oxycanus</i>, since the name <i>Porina</i> is preoccupied as a molluscan genus.

Quote: Marbles had a language of its own. There were names for the marbles, the games, and all the various aspects of the play. There were terms for marbles such as `taw' or `shooter', referring to the marbles used to fire with; `dubs', `dates', `stakes', `dukes', or `changers', referring to the marbles put down to be fired at. Then there were the terms referring to particular kinds of marbles: for example, agates, aggies, aggotties, American alleys, blood alleys, bomb-squashers, bonies, bonsers, bottlies, bull's eyes, bum-squashers, cat's eyes, chinkies, connies, duckies, eggies, glassies, Greeks, milkies, molly-bars, mulley-bars [mullibars: large marbles], peelies, peewees, piss-wees, pretties, Scotties, Scottish alleys, smokies, stinkies, stonies, stripies, tom-bobblers, white alleys, and in more recent years ball-bearings, chippies, plastics, and woodies.

Quote: The couple have developed the Greeline Composite sheep, a genetic package which at this stage comprises quarter East Friesian, three-eighths Texel and three-eighths Coopworth. ... Dunlop says driving the decision to develop the Greeline is the increasing emphasis being placed on and value being derived from lamb production. ... One of the results of the changing relativities between the returns from lamb meat and crossbred wool has been the development over the past decade of composite breed options such as the Greeline that followed the availability in New Zealand of the Texel and East Friesian.

Caples goes on to say that `Other night-loving birds, such as the keewee and green-bird promenaded around our camp all night.' ... [104] However I favour the conclusion that their `native emu' was the large type of kiwi (roa).

Quote: GREENBONE, BUTTERFISH, KELP SALMON, or KELPIE (MARARI) <i>Coridodax pullus</i> (Bloch and Schneider) ... The name Greenbone is given on account of the bones being a bright green colour, which is so permanent as to with-stand boiling or bleaching. ... The name kelp-fish is given on account of its habit of feeding on kelp or seaweed, and also because it likes to make its home among kelp. In such a habitat it has both food and a favourite home. Kelp-salmon is given for two reasons. The first part, kelp, is explained in the last paragraph, while the second half, salmon, is because the fish is not unlike a Salmon in shape, so much so that new chums who caught this fish have been under the impression they had caught the protected introduced Salmon, but of that later in this chapter. But why this dark coloured fish should receive the name Butterfish I am unable to say. It is certainly not as some people suggest because it needs butter with it when cooked or eaten. In Auckland the fish known to South Islanders as Spotty (<i>Pseudolabrus celidotus</i>) is called Butterfish on account of its bright golden colouring on the lower parts of the body and fins fancifully resembling the colour of butter. The name Kelpie, of course, is derived from its habit of living amidst kelp and it is easily understood how the `ie' was tacked on by fishermen.

Butterfish or Greenbone are possibly the more generally used names for this fish ... <i>Ibid.</i> 169 Butterfish <i>Corridodax pullus</i> Greenbone; Kelp Salmon; Kelpi; Kelpfish ...

Quote: Some of the runholders now thought of two new devices to preserve their estates. The first consisted of buying a series of 20 acre sections fronting on a road, [123] so spaced as to leave between them sections of 19 acres. Under the Waste Lands Regulations, none of less than 20 acres could be bought except by having it put up to auction. Few people would go to the trouble of having this done; and anyone who did was in all probability a man of small means, who stood little chance of outbidding the runholder. It usually happened, therefore, that all these 19-acre sections were retained without having to be purchased. This was known as `gridironing.'

If spotting is practiced - the purchase of selected areas with water and shelter for the control this gave over the surrounding country - a study of the Crown grant index maps and of the dates of the original titles supplies no evidence of it.

Quote: `Gridironing' was the practice of buying twenty acre sections fronting on a road, so spaced as to leave sections of 19 acres between them, and as these had to be auctioned the small farmer stood little chance of out bidding the runholder who usually retained them without having to purchase them. `Spotting' was buying up key positions, fertile land, and leaving the barren, water courses, entrances to valleys, road lines ...

Quote: Where land was auctioned the system known as `grid-ironing' was useful: the leaseholder would buy a series of sections each of, say, twenty acres along a frontage, leaving perhaps eighteen acres between sections. Since no one but a poor man would want so small an area, the leaseholder could count on outbidding any rival.

Fences and cottages could be so disposed as to give the runholder rights over the best of the land - Sources of water and wood, strips surrounding isolated and thus inaccessible pockets. `Grid-ironing' and `spotting', as these selective practices were called, were certainly used by many runholders to tie up large areas, but probably not to the extent alleged by horrified land tenure radicals in later years.

Quote: Vervain (<i>Verbena officinalis</i>), a species few would suspect of harm, but which by overrunning grass has proved a nuisance in a small way, is an alien of note. It has invaded us from the north, a quarter from which comparatively few road-plants have come. Its proper name has been temporarily lost, it has been renamed, and, what must be almost unique in popular botanical nomenclature, that name again lost and the plant locally rechristened ; finally, it has resumed its correct designation. This alien from southern England appeared near Frazertown in the late 'seventies. It was first noticed on a station belonging to Mr Nairn; there it began to spread, and there it became known as Nairn's weed; the station then became the property of the late Mr Griffin. Now Mr Griffin, as chairman of the Wairoa County Council, touched the business and bosom of every up-country settler in the district. People knew him who did not know and had never known his predecessor; his office advertised the plant : presently, even in the [299] immediate vicinity of its origin, the earlier designation was dropped, the later one assumed. It became known up and down the east coast as `Griffin's Weed'.

## "group housing"


WordClass: noun


Origin: [none]

Notes: Jim writes: Hist. (mainly 1950s). A cluster of terms associated with the <i>group housing scheme</i> introduced in 1953 whereby numbers of low-cost houses in a subdivision were built by a private builder for sale - <i>group house, group housing, group builder</i>. Often the State developed the subdivision and provided services, selling the developed block to a private builder. The scheme offered home ownership as an alternative to State rental houses and was very popular... These terms are not recorded in DNZE. Note - 1. Of possible linguistic interest is the official use in this context of the term <i>block</i> in the sense of an area subdivided for group (or State) housing and <i>site</i> (not <i>lot</i>) in the sense of an individual section in such a block. There is no trace in the literature I have seen of the English term <i>housing estate</i>. 2. Group houses are associated in my recollection with <i>parades of homes</i>, at which the variety of homes in a group housing block were open for inspection by prospective buyers. This term seems to extend slightly the ordinary meanings of <i>parade</i> and is possibly a distinctive NZE compound.

Quote: The gum-spear, a slender, rapier-like instrument, fitted with an ordinary spade handle, varied in length from about three feet for use in shallow ground, to twenty-five or more for working deep swamps. Some time after its introduction, the spear came to be fitted with what was called the `joker,' or `toggle'. This was a coil of fine wire, bound round the spear [50] a few inches from the point. It allowed the spear to be thrust into the ground with the minimum of resistance, there being no `drag' on the shaft. It is said that the forerunner of the `joker' was discovered by accident. A digger, pushing his spear into the ground, found that it had penetrated a boot-eyelet, and was surprised to find that, instead of forming an obstruction, the spear penetrated the ground more easily; the coil of fine wire was devised as an improvement. An experienced digger could detect at once, by the feel, and the resistance met by the spear, whether he had struck timber, a stone or gum.

Quote: Ages of sheep. Although there are many variations, the following names are usually used: A sheep is a lamb until weaned. After weaning a lamb is called a hogget until shorn. A male lamb is a ram lamb until castrated, then a wether. A female lamb is a ewe lamb. After shearing, a ewe or ram lamb is usually called a shorn hogget until cutting the first two teeth. It is then called a two-tooth. Some use the term two-tooth as soon as the lamb is shorn. Next year the sheep is a four-tooth, then a six-tooth and then an eight-tooth or full-mouthed sheep. It is full-mouthed as long as the teeth remain perfect but then becomes broken-mouthed and gummy. <i>Ibid.</i> 96 Gummy. An old sheep that has lost all its teeth and reached the end of its useful existence.

Some men who are what we term `guns,' are kept going all the season, and in many cases good honest shearers are cast off to make room for these `guns.' Of course, the `gun' shearer who comes along does not know that this has happened, as the `gun' shearers are as a rule good unionists, and would not demean themselves by `waiting for a death.' At the same time, the `boss' knows when the gun is cutting out, perhaps 200 miles away, and he knows from the other boss which way the `gun' is going, and everything is in readiness when he arrives at the shed.

The original word <i>Gurnard</i> is retained in New Zealand, and applied to the new species <i>Trigla kumu (kumu</>being the Maori name), family <i>Cottidae</i>. The <i>Flying Gurnet</i> is <i>Trigla polyommata</i>, Richards., found on all the Australian coasts from New South Wales to Western Australia, family <i>Cottidae</i>. It is a distinct species, not included in the British species. They have large pectoral fins, but are not known to possess the power of supporting themselves in the air like the `flying fish' which belong to other genera. Sir Fredk. McCoy says that <i>Sebastes Percoides</i>, Richards., is called Gurnet, or Garnet-perch, by the fishermen and dealers, as well as the more common <i>Neosebastes scorpaenoides,</i> Guich., and <i>Scorpaena panda</i>, Richards.
